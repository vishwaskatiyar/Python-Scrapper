In the pivotal US LIGHTSITE III trial, the Valeda treatment met its primary endpoint and was shown to be safe and effective in increasing and maintaining improved visual acuity.1</p><p>LumiThera submitted the US LIGHTSITE III clinical data as part of a technical package to the FDA under a De Novo request with special controls.1</p><p>Lori Holder, Vice President, Regulatory Affairs, LumiThera, spoke to this milestone moment, saying, “The De Novo authorization established Valeda as the first device for treatment of dry AMD patients with vision loss and creates a threshold for this novel class of photobiomodulation (PBM) devices that must show similar clinical and nonclinical performance controls equivalent to the Valeda Light Delivery System.”1</p><p>David Boyer, MD, Retina Vitreous Associates Medical Group, Beverly Hills, California, noted the previous results with this device and the potential benefit to patients with dry AMD. In the press release1, he is quoted as saying, “The RCT results demonstrated clinical benefits in early to intermediate dry AMD patients out to 24 months and an excellent safety profile. Patients will now be able to try a non-invasive treatment that can help improve their vision earlier in the disease process. This is an exciting option for patients and something doctors and patients have been waiting for.”</p><p>“The primary endpoint for the study was visual acuity gain,” indicated Glenn Jaffe, MD, Duke Reading Center. However, we also followed multiple anatomical endpoints from BL throughout the 24-month study to determine whether PBM helped to preserve retinal anatomy. The PBM treatment had a beneficial effect on multiple anatomic biomarkers. For example, we looked at whether PBM affected progression to geographic atrophy and found that incident geographic atrophy was reduced in the PBM-treated eyes compared to the sham treated eyes respectively, 6.8% versus 24%. Although incident GA was not a prespecified clinical endpoint, the results supported overall safety benefits of treating earlier in dry AMD disease.1</p><p>Clark Tedford, PhD, President and CEO, shared how this can benefit patients in the US with AMD, saying “We have been working hard to bring Valeda, a multiwavelength photobiomodulation device to our US patients for several years. We now have a non-invasive treatment option for dry AMD patients that may improve vision and address the disease earlier, before permanent vision loss. The FDA authorization of the Valeda treatment to improve vision in dry AMD now provides a significant option for our US patients.”1Reference:</p><p>Exegenesis Bio provides an update on EXG102 and EXG202 for wet AMD</p><p>Discrimination in ophthalmology in the US</p><p>Industry updates from Floretina ICOOR 2024</p><p>Recyclable ophthalmic instrument company HASA OPTIX receives B Corporation certification</p><p>Nerve cells of blind mice retain their visual function</p><p>Outlook Therapeutics reveals preliminary topline results of NORSE EIGHT</p><p>Exegenesis Bio provides an update on EXG102 and EXG202 for wet AMD</p><p>Discrimination in ophthalmology in the US</p><p>Industry updates from Floretina ICOOR 2024</p><p>Recyclable ophthalmic instrument company HASA OPTIX receives B Corporation certification</p><p>Nerve cells of blind mice retain their visual function</p><p>Outlook Therapeutics reveals preliminary topline results of NORSE EIGHT</p><p>2 Commerce DriveCranbury, NJ 08512</p><p>609-716-7777</p>
