Kay, MD, Vitreo Retinal Associates, said in a statement.1“In addition, the TEASE-3 data indicate the potential value of treating patients with Stargardt disease as early as possible, before the onset of progressive central vision loss.”</p><p>Without an FDA-approved treatment, Stargardt affects approximately 30,000 to 87,000 people in the US.4Gildeuretinol has previously received Breakthrough Therapy and Orphan Drug designations from the FDA.1</p><p>“Together, these achievements recognize the significant unmet medical need in Stargardt disease and the overwhelming burden on patients as well as their families and caregivers,” Dahan added.1</p><p>For more insight into the TEASE trials, watch a full HCPLive interview with Kay discussing the promise of gildeuretinol for Stargardt at AAO 2024.3</p><p>“It was exciting to be able to give the first randomized, controlled trial that has shown efficacy in Stargardt presentation," Kay toldHCPLive.3"This drug has orphan drug status and breakthrough designation status from the FDA, and the company is moving forward with the FDA pathway shortly, so we'll be excited to follow along and see how things go."</p><p>References</p><p>Related Content:</p>
