                    <p>There were 1,562 press releases posted in the last 24 hours and 399,948 in the last 365 days.</p><p>SAN DIEGO, Nov.  12, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Belite Bio, Inc (NASDAQ: BLTE) (“Belite” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical drug development company focused on advancing novel therapeutics targeting degenerative retinal diseases that have significant unmet medical needs, today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a general business update.</p><p>“I am pleased with the continued progress we made across our clinical programs. The pace of enrollment for the PHOENIX trial remains strong, and in the quarter, we completed the Phase 1b DRAGON II trial of Tinlarebant in Stargardt disease in Japan and dosed the first patient in the Phase 2/3 portion of the trial. We are well-positioned to achieve critical milestones and look forward to providing an update on the interim analysis from our pivotal Phase 3 DRAGON trial toward the end of 2024 or early 2025,” said Dr. Tom Lin, Chairman and CEO of Belite. “In the quarter, we were also excited to welcome Dr. Scholl, a leading global expert in Stargardt disease and age-related macular degeneration, as our Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Scholl’s decision to join Belite following his experience as Chair of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board for both our Phase 2 and Phase 3 Stargardt disease trials further validates our belief in Tinlarebant’s immense potential.”</p><p>Third Quarter 2024 Business Highlights and Upcoming Milestones:</p><p>Clinical Highlights</p><p>Tinlarebant(LBS-008) is an oral, potent, once daily retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) antagonist that decreases RBP4 levels in the blood and reduces vitamin A (retinol) delivery to the eye without disrupting systemic retinol delivery to other tissues. Vitamin A is critical to normal vision but can accumulate as toxic byproducts in individuals affected with STGD1 and GA (the advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration (dry AMD) leading to retinal cell death and loss of vision.</p><p>Corporate Highlights</p><p>Hendrik P. N. Scholl, MD, MA, was appointed as the Company’s Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Scholl is the foremost globally recognized authority on Stargardt disease and age-related macular degeneration and brings to Belite decades of expertise in treating retinal diseases, including the two key indications targeted by Tinlarebant.</p><p>Belite also recently announced the exercise of warrants by certain holder of Belite’s outstanding warrants, pursuant to which Belite received total gross proceeds of approximately $28.75 million, which are expected to be used for general corporate purposes.</p><p>Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results:</p><p>Current Assets:</p><p>As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $109.0 million in cash, money market fund, time deposits and U.S treasury bills.</p><p>R&D Expenses:</p><p>For the three months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses were $6.8 million compared to $8.7 million for the same period in 2023. This decrease was mainly attributed to fewer contract research organization milestone payments related to the DRAGON trial, partially offset by the increase in the DRAGON II trial expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses were $22.7 million compared to $20.0 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to (i) a royalty payment for completion of a Phase 2 trial, and (ii) share-based compensation granted in the third quarter of 2024.</p><p>G&A Expenses:</p><p>For the three months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were $2.9 million compared to $2.2 million for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administration expenses were $5.9 million compared to $4.7 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in G&A expenses was primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation granted in the third quarter of 2024.</p><p>Other Income:</p><p>For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other income was $1.1 million compared to $0.03 million for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other income was $2.5 million compared to $0.08 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in other income was attributable to accrued interest from time deposits and U.S. treasury bills.</p><p>Net Loss:</p><p>For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported a net loss of $8.7 million, compared to a net loss of $10.9 million for the same period in 2023.
