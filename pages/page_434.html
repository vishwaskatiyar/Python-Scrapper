The first patient was recently dosed in the Phase 3 LUGANO clinical trial of Duravyu for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration. Today, I’m joined by Ash Abbey, principal investigator of the LUGANO clinical trial. First, what are the key points in the latest data from this clinical trial?</p><p>Ash Abbey, MD:We have data from the Phase 2 trial, which we can use to guide our approach in the Phase 3 trial. The Phase 2 trial was called DAVIO 2. In that trial, we now have a full year of data showing a significant reduction in treatment burden for patients who received EYP-1901, the implant currently being used in the Phase 3 trial. In terms of safety, in the nearly 200 patients treated with EYP-1901, we haven’t seen any significant differences in adverse events between EYP-1901 therapy and standard injections, such as aflibercept, which was the comparator in the DAVIO 2 trial. So far, EYP-1901 shows a good safety profile. Many patients with the implant did not require any rescue injections for about 6 months after treatment in the DAVIO 2 trial.</p><p>David Hutton:Can you explain the main objectives and design of the LUGANO clinical trial, and what distinguishes it from previous studies?</p><p>Ash Abbey, MD:The LUGANO clinical trial is primarily a non-inferiority trial. The main goal is to demonstrate a non-inferior change in visual acuity compared with the current standard of care, which is aflibercept, with three loading doses followed by every-other-month dosing. In this trial, the control arm will receive aflibercept in that regimen, while the treatment arm will receive a higher dose of EYP-1901. Patients in the treatment arm will receive 3 loading doses of anti-VEGF injections, specifically aflibercept, and on the third injection, they will also receive EYP-1901. Both groups will then be monitored monthly for rescue treatment needs, with aflibercept available as a rescue option for up to 2 years.</p><p>The secondary endpoint is the reduction in treatment burden, which is essential because EYP-1901 might allow for every-six-month dosing, with supplemental anti-VEGF injections only as needed. However, in this trial, EYP-1901 will be administered every 6 months for the treatment group for the full two years.</p><p>David Hutton:What are the key patient outcomes being measured, and how will you use these metrics to assess treatment efficacy?</p><p>Ash Abbey, MD:A key outcome will be maintaining visual acuity. In the DAVIO 2 trial, we saw that 1 dose of EYP-1901 was non-inferior to standard aflibercept dosing over a year. We hope to see similar outcomes in the LUGANO trial with every-6-month dosing. The reduction in treatment burden while maintaining good visual acuity is crucial.</p><p>We’ll also look at anatomical markers, specifically central subfield thickness and fluid on OCT. EYP-1901 is designed to provide zero-order kinetic release, offering a consistent release of medication over 6 to 9 months. This should help stabilize vascular leakage and reduce anatomical fluctuations, which are linked to worse visual outcomes over time. We hope that with consistent EYP-1901 treatment, we may see better long-term visual outcomes.</p><p>David Hutton:What unique challenges have you faced during this trial?</p><p>Ash Abbey, MD:So far, it’s been relatively easy to enroll patients. Many who have been treated with anti-VEGF injections but can’t go beyond 6 to 8 weeks between doses are eager to reduce their treatment burden. These patients are highly interested in the possibility of only needing an injection every 6 months. However, only 25% of the trial participants will be previously treated patients. Once we reach that limit, we’ll need to recruit treatment-naive patients, which may be more challenging. Still, emphasizing the potential for fewer treatments should help attract participants.</p><p>David Hutton:Based on the data collected so far, are you seeing any promising trends or findings?</p><p>Ash Abbey, MD:We’re just beginning Phase 3, but in Phase 2 DAVIO 2, we observed promising trends, including a stable central subfield thickness over time, which is a key anatomical marker. In contrast to every-other-month dosing with Eylea, EYP-1901 has shown a more stable trend over 6 months to a year. Achieving dry retinas with fewer injections would be a successful outcome, and reduced anatomical fluctuations may lead to a better long-term visual prognosis.</p><p>David Hutton:Lastly, what’s the timeline for LUGANO, and where does it go from here?</p><p>Ash Abbey, MD:LUGANO will likely continue enrolling patients over the next year to year and a half. There’s also a similar trial called LUCIA, which will run in parallel internationally. Once enrollment is complete, and with positive results, we might see potential FDA approval in the next 3 to 4 years.</p><p>Atsena Therapeutics completes dosing in Part A of Phase I/II clinical trial evaluating ATSN-201 to treat X-linked retinoschisis</p><p>Connect, learn, and innovate in a family-friendly atmosphere:  What to expect at EnVision Summit 2025</p><p>Phenocell and Amarna Therapeutics awarded Eurostars grant for continued investigation of dry AMD gene therapy platform</p><p>Innovation Series: Expanding access to eye care, advice for aspiring innovators from DMEI ophthalmology residents (part 3)</p><p>Beacon Therapeutics announces positive 3-month data from Phase 2 DAWN trial of AGTC-501 in patients with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa</p><p>New study highlights retinopathy risk from hair dye use</p><p>Atsena Therapeutics completes dosing in Part A of Phase I/II clinical trial evaluating ATSN-201 to treat X-linked retinoschisis</p><p>Connect, learn, and innovate in a family-friendly atmosphere:  What to expect at EnVision Summit 2025</p><p>Phenocell and Amarna Therapeutics awarded Eurostars grant for continued investigation of dry AMD gene therapy platform</p><p>Innovation Series: Expanding access to eye care, advice for aspiring innovators from DMEI ophthalmology residents (part 3)</p><p>Beacon Therapeutics announces positive 3-month data from Phase 2 DAWN trial of AGTC-501 in patients with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa</p><p>New study highlights retinopathy risk from hair dye use</p><p>2 Commerce DriveCranbury, NJ 08512</p><p>609-716-7777</p>
