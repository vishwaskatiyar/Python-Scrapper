Khanani, MD, MA</p><p>November 04, 2024</p><p>Dr Arshad Khanani reports on several compelling talks given at the neovascular AMD session at AAO 2024. Dr Barbara Blodi presented higher rates of macular atrophy in patients treated with anti-VEGF compared with sham treatments in theMARINA study. Dr Usha Chakravarthy emphasized the need for consensus on fibrosis biomarkers to improve visual acuity outcomes, while Dr Gemmy Cheung found that combination therapies with photodynamic treatment could optimize results for patients with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy.Turning toward a different aspect of research, Dr Marco Zarbin highlighted how different re-treatment criteria in phase 3 clinical trials can significantly affect durability outcomes. His analysis showed that varying the criteria from "and" to "or" can lead to notable differences in patient outcomes, underscoring the importance of these criteria in interpreting clinical trial data.</p><p>Medscape © 2024 WebMD, LLC</p><p>Any views expressed above are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect the views of WebMD or Medscape.</p><p></p><p>Cite this: AAO 2024: Key Insights on Wet AMD -Medscape- Nov 04, 2024.</p><p>Clinical Professor, Department of Surgery, University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine; Director of Clinical Research, Sierra Eye Associates, Reno, NevadaDisclosure: Arshad M.
