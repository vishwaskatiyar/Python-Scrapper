                    <p>According to the study conducted by the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in the USA and published in Science Daily on November 16, demands on healthcare institutions witheye disordersare increasing in parallel with the increase inparticulate matter(PM) caused byair pollutionin the atmosphere.</p><p>The researchers examined daily PM concentrations in the Denver metropolitan area and eye irritation and allergic disorders. As part of the study, the researchers calculatedPM10(diameter of 10 micrometers or less) andPM2.5(diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less) and examined in detail 144 thousand 313 visits to healthcare institutions due to irritation to eyes and allergies. ​​​​​​​</p><p>As a result, half of the complaints related to dry eye syndrome and conjunctivitis, also known as red eye disease, which can develop due to environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and air pollution, made up 1/3 of the complaints.</p><p>The study concluded that when the daily concentration of PM10, which should be 45 micrograms per cubic meter, reached 110, according to the criteria established by the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of patients was 2.2 times higher than the average.</p><p>The study’s lead author, Jennifer Patnaik, Ph. Even less studied chronic diseases like dementia have been found to be linked to temperature and air pollutants. Research on eye diseases and climate is still in its infancy. “Much more work is needed to better understand how pollutants affect eye health.”</p><p>Dr. Özgür Yaşar said that air pollution can cause respiratory problems, cancer, neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases and serious eye problems.</p><p>Yaşar said that the cornea, which is the most sensitive structure in the human body, is sensitive to environmental factors due to the transparent layer in the outermost part of the eye and the numerous nerve connections on the surface of the eye, and continued: ” When the eyes are open, they provide defense against harmful external substances with only a thin layer of tear film. Therefore, our eyes are sensitive to the negative effects of air pollution and cause irritation inflammation in our eyes Allergic conjunctivitis and glaucoma can also occur following long-term exposure to air pollution. Additionally, studies have shown that long-term exposure to tobacco smoke can cause cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). ) is caused by traffic-related air pollution. Exposure to ultraviolet rays is another risk factor for pollution-related eye problems such as photokeratitis, cortical cataracts. pinguecula and pterygium. is the problem.”</p><p>Stating that there are differences in pollutants along with seasonal changes, Yaşar warned that one must watch out for fog and smoke increasing in the sky in the winter months and increased exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays in the summer months.</p><p>Yaşar, who advised not to go out as much as possible when air pollution is high, concluded his words as follows: “At these times, often washing our face and the area around the eyes with plenty of water will help keep pollutants away. away from our eyes. In case of exposure to pollutants, it is also very useful to wash the eyes with artificial tears.” “However, using UV-protective sunglasses in the summer months, when UV exposure increases, can protect against the negative effects of UV rays on eye health.”</p>
