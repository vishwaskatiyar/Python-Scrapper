                    <p>Alex Delaney-Gesing</p><p>Fresh offannouncing 52-week phase 2 data, Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc. has alsoreleased long-term datafrom its OPTIC program that’s clinically evaluating Ixoberogene soroparvovec (Ixo-vec) for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD.</p><p>The clinical-stage gene therapy company’scandidate pipelineconsists of durable, single-administration therapies intended to be administered in-office via a proprietary intravitreal (IVT) platform.</p><p>Itsocular disease focusincludes:</p><p>AAV.7m8.,an adeno-associated virus (AAV) transgene vector technologydesigned to encode retinal cellsto “become biofactories that provide robust, sustainable amounts of therapeutic proteins throughout the retina.”</p><p>A peptide loop within the platform also enables AAV.7m8 to:</p><p>The end result: The targeted delivery of a therapeutic payload at the location of the specific retinal disease (such as wet AMD, for Ixo-vec).</p><p>As Adverum’s lead asset, Ixo-vec is a vectorized aflibercept (an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]) coding sequence that’s controlled by a proprietary expression cassette optimized exclusively for IVT injection.</p><p>Specifically:Ixo-vec incorporates this AAV.7m8 platform to provide aflibercept as the therapeutic protein throughout the retina.</p><p>And its regulatory status: The candidate has received both Fast Track and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation (granted this past August) for wet AMD.</p><p>Similar to the 3-year findings, Adverumreportedthat patients continued to “experience long-term benefit from Ixo-vec through at least 4 years of follow up.”</p><p>This included:</p><p>Thecompany notedthat patients had an86%reduction in annualized anti-VEGF injections (through year 4)—which was similar to reductions seen in each of the previous years following Ixo-vec administration.</p><p>The findings only further supported the gene therapy, with almost50% of patients injection-freethrough 4 years after treatment.</p><p>Specifically:A total of78%and88%of patients who were injection-free through year 1 and and year 2, respectively, werealso injection-freethrough year 4.</p><p>Ixo-vec was found to be “generally well tolerated” and demonstrated a “favorable safety profile.”</p><p>All occurrences of inflammation were dose-dependent, had no impact on vision, and were responsive to local corticosteroids,according toAdverum.</p><p>Indeed. In fact, Adverum President and CEO Laurent Fischer, MD,statedthat the “consistent results” of the 52-week LUNA data (reported earlier) are only bolstered by the “OPTIC long-term data, where we have demonstrated stable therapeutic aflibercept levels through 5 years.”</p><p>Together, the data supports “a reliable, long-term benefit and a predictable safety profile,” headded.</p><p>The company ispreparing to initiatetwo double-masked, randomized phase 3 trials to further reevaluate Ixo-vec (as a 6E10 vg/eye dose)—with the first anticipated for kickoff in H1 2025.</p><p>Charles Wkyoff, MD, PhD, a principal investigator for the Adverum’s phase 2 LUNA trial,spoke on the datafrom both LUNA and OPTIC program:</p><p>"These data… suggest a favorable benefit-risk profile for patients, which I believe many patients would consider if Ixo-vec were available in routine clinical practice.”</p><p>Headded: “The totality of data indicates a predictable immune response with inflammation that, if it occurs, is manageable with local steroids, doesn’t impact vision, and ultimately resolves.</p><p>Adverum President and CEO Laurent Fischer, MD,notedthat both OPTIC’s Ixo-vec dosage of 2E11 results and thephase 2 LUNA efficacy dataat 52 weeks show maintenance of visual and anatomic endpoints “with over 80% reduction in injection burden and greater than 50% injection freedom.”</p><p>Heconcluded: “The data across both studies support a reliable long-term benefit and a predictable safety profile.”</p><p>Eyes On Eyecare is currently distributing our 2024 media kit and Eyes On event prospectuses.
