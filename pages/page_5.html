(Nasdaq: CGTX),a clinical-stage company developing product candidates that treat neurodegenerative disorders, (the “Company” or “Cognition”) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a business update.“In the third quarter and recent weeks Cognition Therapeutics achieved one of the most important milestones in its history as the Phase 2 SHINE study results became available. Among the many findings in the SHINE study, new and compelling data presented at CTAD showed a near-total preservation of cognition (as measured by the ADAS-Cog11 and MMSE scales) in a sub-group of Alzheimer’s patients treated with CT1812 who had p-tau217 levels below median,” said Lisa Ricciardi, Cognition’s president and CEO. “We are moving rapidly to advance CT1812 in Alzheimer’s disease and plan to request an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA where we will review CT1812’s safety and tolerability profile as well as the totality of results from SHINE. We will seek alignment with the FDA on a pivotal Phase 3 program design in light of recent findings relating to lower levels of plasma p-tau217, an important biomarker of Alzheimer’s disease pathology easily measured with a blood test.”Ms. Ricciardi concluded: “In addition to the substantial progress we have made with CT1812 in Alzheimer’s disease, we expect to report top-line results from our Phase 2 SHIMMER study in mild-to-moderate dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) by the end of this year. DLB is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, yet few therapies have been studied in this indication and no disease-modifying treatments exist. SHIMMER will deliver safety and tolerability data in a second indication and potentially provide insights to be integrated into a larger clinical study in this under-studied and under-represented population.”AdvertisementBusiness and Corporate HighlightsResults of a pre-specified analysis from the Phase 2 SHINE study of CT1812 in participants with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease were presented in an oral session at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) conferencePatients with baseline levels of p-tau217 below the median showed a 95% slowing of cognitive decline on the ADAS-Cog11 scale and 108% slowing of cognitive decline on the MMSE scale*Lower levels of plasma p‑tau217 are indicative of less advanced Alzheimer’s pathology, and we believe may identify patients likely to have a greater response to therapyThe CTAD presentation by Dr. Michael Woodward and an archive of investor webinar are available on the Cognition websiteBaseline characteristics of participants enrolled in the Phase 2 SHIMMER study were also presented at CTAD, confirming enrollment of individuals with mild-to-moderate DLBContinued enrollment in Phase 2 START study (NCT05531656) in early Alzheimer’s disease and Phase 2 MAGNIFY study (NCT05893537) in geographic atrophy secondary to dry age-related macular degenerationStory ContinuesThird Quarter 2024 Financial ResultsCash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 were approximately $22.0 million and total grant funds remaining from the NIA were $53.6 million. The Company estimates that it has sufficient cash to fund operations and capital expenditures into the second quarter of 2025.Research and development expenses were $11.4 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $11.7 million for the comparable period in 2023. The decrease was primarily related to lower costs with contract manufacturing organizations for the production of pre-clinical and future clinical trial supply.General and administrative expenses were $3.1 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $3.1 million for the comparable period in 2023. The change in general & administrative expenses was not significant in either period.AdvertisementThe Company reported a net loss of $9.9 million, or $(0.25) per basic and diluted share for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $6.7 million, or $(0.22) per basic and diluted share for the same period in 2023.*  ADAS-Cog11: Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale (11-task version); MMSE: Mini Mental State ExaminationAbout Cognition Therapeutics, Inc.Cognition Therapeutics, Inc., is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing innovative, small molecule therapeutics targeting age-related degenerative disorders of the central nervous system and retina. We currently are investigating our lead candidate CT1812 in clinical programs in Alzheimer’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and dry age-related macular degeneration (dry AMD). We believe CT1812 and our pipeline of σ-2 receptor modulators can regulate pathways that are impaired in these diseases that are functionally distinct from other approaches for the treatment of degenerative diseases.

Among the many findings in the SHINE study, new and compelling data presented at CTAD showed a near-total preservation of cognition (as measured by the ADAS-Cog11 and MMSE scales) in a sub-group of Alzheimer’s patients treated with CT1812 who had p-tau217 levels below median,” said Lisa Ricciardi, Cognition’s president and CEO. “We are moving rapidly to advance CT1812 in Alzheimer’s disease and plan to request an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA where we will review CT1812’s safety and tolerability profile as well as the totality of results from SHINE. We will seek alignment with the FDA on a pivotal Phase 3 program design in light of recent findings relating to lower levels of plasma p-tau217, an important biomarker of Alzheimer’s disease pathology easily measured with a blood test.”Ms. Ricciardi concluded: “In addition to the substantial progress we have made with CT1812 in Alzheimer’s disease, we expect to report top-line results from our Phase 2 SHIMMER study in mild-to-moderate dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) by the end of this year. DLB is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, yet few therapies have been studied in this indication and no disease-modifying treatments exist.

denied Mayor Adams access to more than $4 million in matching funds for his reelection fight — showing yet again the profoundly undemocratic nature of New York’s public-campaign-finance system.The

April.And those charges themselves sure look like they’re motivated by politics (i.e. payback to Adams for challenging President Biden on the border crisis).Yes, when it comes to the public fisc, even the appearance of impropriety is supposed to be a big no-no.And Adams can appeal the decision; he still has millions in his war chest;etc. etc.AdvertisementBut this is at least a serious wound to his candidacy.More FromPost Editorial BoardAgain, at the hands of the CFB, which is neither directly elected nor remotely answerable to the voters of New York, nor really toanyone.Yet it behaves as though it has the public mandate to shape and even decide election outcomes.Consider the 2013 mayoral race: The CFB suddenly denied matching funds to then-Comptroller John Liu over alleged corruption, too — and so cleared the left lane of the Democratic primary (and near-certain victory in the general election) for a lumbering, communist-loving dimwit from Cambridge, Bill de Blasio.AdvertisementThatproved to be deeply consequential for all New Yorkers, eventually ushering in an era of high crime, failing schools, COVID insanity and general civic decay.(The CFB also impacted the mayoral race in 2000, by the way, making up rules on the fly about what funds could go out the door for what after the 9/11 attacks forced a postponement of the primaries.)Now all the leftists taking aim at Adams are jumping with joy overthisdecision.The matching-funds rules themselves increase the field of candidates who’ve learned how to work the public-finance system, paying out an unthinkably lavish $8 for each (apparently) qualifying $1 in donations.All on the taxpayers’ dime.AdvertisementNew York City progressives love to scream and shout that democracy is under

Professionals from Latin America have a similar work culture to their North American neighbors and possess a high level of English proficiency.”AdvertisementAs a result of this type of demand, many BairesDev workers who once faced limited opportunities in rural areas now earn between $30,000 and $80,000 annually, placing them in the top 5% of earners in their home countries.Other companies like Toptal and Adeva work in similar ways to connect talented and skilled individuals to job opportunities around the world, breaking down barriers to entry and revitalizing local economies.If you’re considering a remote job that can connect you to a different corner of the global marketplace, here are some important things to consider as you embark on your job hunt.Earn Globally, Live LocallyOne of the most significant advantages of remote work is the ability to earn in a high-income market while living in a lower-cost region. BairesDev, for instance, has had more than 6,000 of its Latin American-based workers integrate with teams in U.S. companies, like Google and Pinterest.Advertisement“During recruitment, we focus on a candidate’s competence over their credentials,” explains De Marco. “We also prioritize the future potential that someone can bring, in addition to their current skillset. This approach means discovering exceptional talent from diverse and often overlooked sources. Historically, around 40% of our developers come from non-metropolitan areas.”Yes, that means you can live a balanced lifestyle in a quaint town like San Miguel de Allende while working with a U.S.-based tech giant.Earning a higher paycheck while keeping your cost of living steady provides wealth-building opportunities, allowing you to build an emergency fund, pay off debt, and invest in property and other assets. Be sure to cross check the purchasing power of the currency you’ll be paid in to that of your local currency to ensure that you’re maximizing your potential earnings. Also make sure that the salary you’re being offered is fair compared to what employees at the company’s headquarters are making.Track Finances CarefullyOnce you’ve secured your remote job, you’ll want to set up a financial plan to ensure that you are maximizing your global paycheck without running into any snags. Opening a multi-currency bank account can help you minimize exchange rate losses and transfer fees, and many offer automations to make conversions between currencies seamless.Also make sure to budget for any potential fluctuations in the foreign currency, as factors like inflation, interest rate adjustments, and governmental changes can affect the value of the foreign currency. As long as you’re earning well above your local cost of living, it’s smart to set aside a percentage of your earnings as a buffer to offset any potential currency devaluation.AdvertisementAs you continue to earn more, it’s also wise to invest a portion of your income into diversified assets so you can grow your wealth over time. Many companies offer financial planning services as a benefit, and it can be especially helpful if you’re a first-time investor. Financial planners can also help you with your taxes, which can be more complicated when earning across borders.Maintain Motivation and Work-life BalanceThough the higher salaries in other countries can sound so enticing that you consider working odd hours, try not to jump at just any opportunity for a higher paycheck. Instead, look at the big picture and consider the fact that your long-term earning potential is contingent upon factors like work-life balance, upskilling, and staying motivated. Working with a talent company like BairesDev can help set you up for success in this regard.“By hiring candidates with strong communication skills and collaborative skills, our workforce is well-prepared to navigate the typical challenges associated with remote work,” says De Marco.For smoother collaboration with your fellow employees– and to remain present in your day-to-day life– look for jobs at companies with similar time zones to yours. This will cause minimal disruptions to your schedule, allowing you time for family and social obligations– and time for learning new skills that can help you land your next job. Popular remote industries like tech, design, and project management tend to be good about providing professional development opportunities outside of the traditional workday, and you want to remain fresh and motivated to seize grown opportunities as they come.Redefining Success: Building Wealth Across BordersIn an increasingly borderless world, the path to financial independence might be closer than you think. Companies like BairesDev are receiving over 2 million applications annually for remote work opportunities—approximately 10,000 applications every day, proving that demand for global remote jobs is continuing to grow.Advertisement“In the U.S., the demand for tech talent is outstripping supply, with roles like information security and software development expected to grow by 33% and 18%, respectively, over the next decade,” says De Marco. “Latin America is rising to meet this demand, with Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina producing significantly more software engineers annually than the U.S.”Opening doors for global talent also sparks a larger shift in how we think about work, money, and opportunity. This is not a small trend; it’s going to continue to be a defining feature of the global economy in the decades to come— and it’s very possible to make this work in your favor.For professionals considering this path, remote work offers a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between higher global earnings and a lower local cost of living. With the right financial strategies—like careful currency management, smart investment strategies, and a focus on work-life balance—there is a very real opportunity for talented employees across the globe to achieve financial freedom without uprooting their lives.</p><p>The remote work revolution has opened doors for skilled professionals like Virginia and Luis worldwide.
