In the trial Valeda met its primary endpoint and was shown to be safe and effective in increasing and maintaining improved visual acuity.1</p><p>“The De Novo authorization established Valeda as the first device for treatment of dry AMD patients with vision loss and creates a threshold for this novel class of PBM devices that must show similar clinical and nonclinical performance controls equivalent to the Valeda Light Delivery System,” said Lori Holder, vice president, regulatory affairs, at LumiThera, Inc. in the press release from the company.</p><p>The LIGHTSITE III was a prospective, double-masked, randomized, multi-center clinical trial, conducted at 10 leading US retinal centers and enrolled 100 subjects with early to intermediate dry AMD.2</p><p>The analysis included 91 eyes in the PBM treatment group and 54 eyes in the sham-treatment group in the modified intent-to-treat population with at least 1 post-treatment visit. The trial initially demonstrated sustained and statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint, BCVA, at 13 months in the PBM treatment group when compared to the sham-treatment group (p = 0.02). Now, a sustained, mean increase in ETDRS letter score >5.0 letters from baseline is reported at both the 13- and 21-month timepoints in the PBM-treated subjects BCVA (p < 0.0001).2</p><p>The improvement from baseline in BCVA at 24 months in the PBM treatment group was significantly greater than in the sham group, 5.9 vs 1.0 letters (p = 0.0015). Approximately 58% of the PBM-treated eyes had >5 letter gain with a mean of 8.5 + 0.5 letter gain.</p><p>Glenn Jaffe, MD, Duke Reading Center, commented on the trial in a release from the company.</p><p>“The primary endpoint for the study was visual acuity gain,” said Jaffe. “We also followed multiple anatomical endpoints from BL throughout the 24-month study to determine whether photobiomodulation [PBM] helped to preserve retinal anatomy. The PBM treatment had a beneficial effect on multiple anatomic biomarkers. For example, we looked at whether PBM affected progression to geographic atrophy and found that incident geographic atrophy was reduced in the PBM-treated eyes compared to the sham treated eyes respectively, 6.8% versus 24%. Although incident GA was not a prespecified clinical endpoint, the results supported overall safety benefits of treating earlier in dry AMD disease.</p><p>Valeda is CE Marked in the EU and is available in select countries in Latin America.</p><p>Phenocell and Amarna Therapeutics awarded Eurostars grant for continued investigation of dry AMD gene therapy platform</p><p>Innovation Series: A stem cell patch for treating advanced dry AMD</p><p>Galimedix Therapeutics initiates phase 1 trial of oral GAL-101</p><p>(EyePod) From idea to impact: Navigating ophthalmic innovation</p><p>EyePoint doses first patient in second global Phase 3 LUCIA clinical trial of Duravyu for the treatment of wet AMD</p><p>AI models offer hope for personalized AMD treatment plans</p><p>Phenocell and Amarna Therapeutics awarded Eurostars grant for continued investigation of dry AMD gene therapy platform</p><p>Innovation Series: A stem cell patch for treating advanced dry AMD</p><p>Galimedix Therapeutics initiates phase 1 trial of oral GAL-101</p><p>(EyePod) From idea to impact: Navigating ophthalmic innovation</p><p>EyePoint doses first patient in second global Phase 3 LUCIA clinical trial of Duravyu for the treatment of wet AMD</p><p>AI models offer hope for personalized AMD treatment plans</p><p>2 Commerce DriveCranbury, NJ 08512</p><p>609-716-7777</p>
