She highlighted the importance of building patient-doctor trust to learn about these practices, which can include non-traditional treatments like chamomile or manuka honey eye drops. Raymondi emphasized the risks associated with non-sterile or improperly sourced remedies, such as infections from unverified sources. She advocated for educating patients on legitimate treatments and using motivational interviewing to ensure compliance and improve health outcomes.</p><p>Watch here...</p><p>By David Hutton, Managing Editor, Opthalmology Times</p><p>Ocugen Inc. announced positive preliminary efficacy and safety data from the Phase 1 dose-escalation segment of the Phase 1/2 OCU410 ArMaDa clinical trial forgeographic atrophy (GA)secondary todry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD).</p><p>Key findings include:</p><p>Read here...</p><p>ByVittorio Mena, OD, MS</p><p>While at Vision Expo West in Las Vegas, Nevada, I was able to attend a 2½-hour lecture called “The Artificial Intelligence Revolution: Practical Applications in Eye Care Today.” It was hosted by optometrists Scot Morris, OD, FAAO; Masoud Nafey, OD, MBA, FAAO; Dena Weitzman, OD, FAAO; and Howard Purcell, OD, FAAO, and special guests Rehan Ahmed, MD, an ophthalmologist from Texas; Sunny Virmani, senior product manager at Google leading the Health AI division; and Easy Anyama, chief information officer at FluoreSCENE Media, founder of ODX Health, and general up-and-comer in AI and eye care.</p><p>Read here...</p><p>By Neda Gioia, OD, CNS, FOWNS, and Jordana Joy, Associate Editor</p><p>Neda Gioia, OD, CNS, FOWNS, discussed a recent study on a supplement containing vitamin D, curcumin, lutein, and zeaxanthin, which showed significant improvements in dry eye symptoms within 14 to 28 days. Key secondary outcomes, such as MMP-9 scores and corneal staining, also improved by day 28 to 56. The supplement has been well-received by optometrists and high-level practitioners, and it offers an alternative to traditional eye drops, especially for contact lens users. Gioia emphasized its potential to expand beyond optometrists to include nutritionists and other healthcare providers in addressing ocular discomfort.</p><p>Watch here...</p><p>Results released in 4-year myopia control study of Diffusion Optics Technology in children</p><p>You and Eye: Vision training research in eSports - with Tiffany Tsoi, OD, FAAO</p><p>EyePoint begins dosing in second global Phase 3 LUCIA clinical trial of Duravyu for the treatment of wet AMD</p><p>You and Eye: Myopia cannot be viewed as a specialty in today's practice setting</p><p>Lifitegrast improves clinical signs and biomarkers of patients with DED: A Q&A with Dr. James Thimons</p><p>Galimedix Therapeutics initiates Phase 1 trial of oral GAL-101</p><p>Results released in 4-year myopia control study of Diffusion Optics Technology in children</p><p>You and Eye: Vision training research in eSports - with Tiffany Tsoi, OD, FAAO</p><p>EyePoint begins dosing in second global Phase 3 LUCIA clinical trial of Duravyu for the treatment of wet AMD</p><p>You and Eye: Myopia cannot be viewed as a specialty in today's practice setting</p><p>Lifitegrast improves clinical signs and biomarkers of patients with DED: A Q&A with Dr. James Thimons</p><p>Galimedix Therapeutics initiates Phase 1 trial of oral GAL-101</p><p>2 Commerce DriveCranbury, NJ 08512</p><p>609-716-7777</p>
