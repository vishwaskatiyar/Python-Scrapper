                    <p>MyChesCo</p><p>Chester County News and Community Website</p><p>MALVERN, PA—Ocugen, Inc.(NASDAQ: OCGN) has reported its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, highlighting significant advancements in its gene therapy programs and financial strategies. The company secured $30 million in debt financing, extending its financial runway into the first quarter of 2026.</p><p>The company’s OCU400 Phase 3 liMeliGhT trial for retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is making notable progress, with the trial expected to complete enrollment by the first half of 2025. The expansion into Canada is a strategic move to broaden the trial’s scope. “I am very encouraged by the progress of our gene therapy programs and the clinical and regulatory milestones achieved,” said Dr. Shankar Musunuri, Chairman, CEO, and Co-founder of Ocugen.</p><p>In addition, Ocugen’s OCU410, designed for geographic atrophy (GA), is in Phase 2 of the Phase 1/2 ArMaDa trial. This innovative approach targets multiple pathways of dry age-related macular degeneration, offering potential advantages over existing treatments that require frequent injections. The OCU410ST for Stargardt disease has also progressed, receiving approval to move to the second phase of its Phase 1/2 GARDian trial. Dr. Musunuri noted, “With the recent equity and debt financings, we have sufficient cash-on-hand to continue supporting our robust ophthalmology pipeline.”</p><p>Ocugen’s financial results reveal operating expenses of $14.4 million for the quarter, a decrease from $16.1 million the previous year, due to careful management of research and administrative costs. This financial prudence, combined with recent financings, supports the company’s ongoing research and development efforts.</p><p>Dr. Musunuri emphasized the unique approach of their gene therapy platform: “Unlike other product candidates in development to treat blindness diseases, our approach leverages master gene regulators that reset the functional network—rather than targeting a single mutation—and restore overall health to the retina.”</p><p>Ocugen is committed to advancing its pipeline and ensuring its innovative therapies reach those in need, positioning itself as a leader in the gene therapy market.</p><p>For the latest news on everything happening in Chester County and the surrounding area, be sure to follow MyChesCo onGoogle NewsandMSN.</p><p>More From MyChesCo</p><p></p><p>From Struggles to Triumph: 45 Teens Break Barriers and Redefine Their Futures at Keystone State ChalleNGe Academy Graduation</p><p>Celebrating 50 Years of Orleans Technical College—A Blueprint for Pennsylvania’s Workforce Future</p><p>No-Cost HIV Prevention in Pennsylvania Revolutionizes Healthcare Access</p><p>Janet Haugen Joins West Pharmaceutical Services Board of Directors</p><p>Chester County’s Wild Weather Ride This Week: From Rainy Skies to Winter Chill – Don’t Get Caught Off Guard!</p><p>First Name</p><p>Last Name</p><p>Email Address</p><p></p><p>December 15, 2024December 14, 2024</p><p>December 14, 2024December 14, 2024</p><p>December 14, 2024December 14, 2024</p>
