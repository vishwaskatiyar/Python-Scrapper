                    <p>Ophthalmology, the branch of medicine concerned with the study and treatment of disorders of the eye, is a field that demands precision, expertise and a deep understanding of the intricate workings of the human eye.From routine eye exams to complex surgical procedures, ophthalmologists play a crucial role in maintaining and restoring vision.To gain further insights into the world of ophthalmology, we spoke to American Mission Hospital (AMH) consultant ophthalmologist Dr Rushabh Doshi.He stressed the importance of regular eye examinations.“Early detection and intervention are key to preventing vision loss. Regular eye exams can help identify potential problems before they progress, allowing for timely treatment,” he said.At the heart of ophthalmology lies a comprehensive approach to eye care. This involves a thorough examination of the eye’s structure and function, including the cornea, lens, retina and optic nerve.Ophthalmologists are trained to diagnose and treat a wide range of conditions, such as refractive errors, cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.One of the most common eye conditions is refractive error, which affects the way the eye focuses light. This can lead to blurry vision, eye strain, and headaches. Refractive errors can be corrected with glasses, contact lenses or refractive surgery.Cataracts, another common eye condition, occur when the lens of the eye becomes cloudy, affecting vision. Cataract surgery is a safe and effective procedure to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with an artificial lens.Glaucoma is a chronic eye disease that damages the optic nerve, leading to gradual vision loss. It is often associated with increased pressure in the eye. Early detection and treatment can help slow the progression of glaucoma and preserve vision.Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common cause of vision loss in older adults. It affects the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision. AMD can be dry or wet, with wet AMD being more aggressive and requiring prompt treatment.Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that can damage the blood vessels in the retina. It can lead to vision loss and even blindness. Regular eye exams are crucial for people with diabetes to monitor for early signs of diabetic retinopathy.In addition to these common conditions, ophthalmologists also treat a variety of other problems, such as eye infections, corneal ulcers, and eye injuries. They may also perform specialised procedures, such as laser surgery and intraocular injections.Dr Doshi highlighted the advanced technology and expertise available at AMH’s ophthalmology department.“We are committed to providing the highest quality eye care to our patients. Our state-of-the-art equipment and experienced team of ophthalmologists enable us to diagnose and treat a wide range of eye conditions through a range of procedures, from routine eye exams to complex surgeries,” he said.As technology continues to advance, so too does the field of ophthalmology. New treatments and surgical techniques are constantly being developed, offering hope for patients with even the most challenging eye conditions.To book a consultation at your desired AMH branch, call 1717 7711 or WhatsApp 3364 4177.</p><p>Ophthalmology, the branch of medicine concerned with the study and treatment of disorders of the eye, is a field that demands precision, expertise and a deep understanding of the intricate workings of the human eye.</p><p>From routine eye exams to complex surgical procedures, ophthalmologists play a crucial role in maintaining and restoring vision.</p><p>To gain further insights into the world of ophthalmology, we spoke to American Mission Hospital (AMH) consultant ophthalmologist Dr Rushabh Doshi.</p><p>He stressed the importance of regular eye examinations.</p><p>“Early detection and intervention are key to preventing vision loss.
