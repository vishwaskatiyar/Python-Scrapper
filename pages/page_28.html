These supplements can mitigate the effects of aging and offer benefits in the prevention of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).</p><p>The study, led by Dr. Amer Alsoudi from Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, United States, aimed to investigate the link between the use of curcumin supplements and the risk of developing or progressing age-related macular degeneration (AMD).</p><p>Conducting a retrospective analysis, the study included individuals aged 50 and older without a history of AMD. This cohort comprised individuals taking curcumin supplements (n = 66,804) and those not taking any (n = 1,809,440). The research evaluated the risk of various AMD types (exudative, non-exudative, advanced non-exudative, and geographic atrophy), blindness, and the need for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) intravitreal therapy.</p><p>Among those without prior MD, curcumin supplement usage was linked to lower risks of non-exudative AMD development (RR: 0.23, 95% CI), advanced non-exudative AMD or geographic atrophy (RR: 0.11, 95% CI), and also non-exudative AMD (RR: 0.28, 95% CI). Moreover, it was found to reduce the need for factors of VEGF intravitreal therapy (RR: 0.15, 95% CI). Notably, early supplementation correlated with reduced risk of progression to advanced non-exudative AMD or geographic atrophy (RR: 0.58, 95% CI).</p><p>The findings suggest that consuming curcumin supplements may decrease the risk of developing AMD or its progression. As with any nutraceutical, further research is warranted to confirm these findings and assess the safety and potential protective mechanisms of curcumin for AMD.</p><p>According to the National Eye Institute, AMD affects approximately 11 million Americans. By 2050, the number of people living with this condition is expected to increase to 14 million due to the aging population.</p><p>"Rapid Increases in Smoking Cause An infant to Develop Pneumonia: Causes of Child Pneumonia"</p><p>While curcumin supplements show promising results, more extensive research and clinical studies are needed to fully validate their efficacy and safety in preventing and managing AMD.</p><p>Curcuma-Based Nutritional Supplements and Risk of Age-Related Macular Degeneration</p><p>Alsoudi AF, et al.
