My name is Kaitlin, here to bring you the health and wellness tips you need to know this week.</p><p>Americans are more stressed about the election than ever before, according toa September YouGov/Yahoo News poll. If you’re struggling to find your calm in these uncertain times, experts recommendtaking control of your environment. Step back from the news if you need to and set boundaries with friends who may want to discuss election info that makes you more anxious. Also, replace doom scrolling with things liketaking a 20-minute walk outside, which can help you feel less more grounded before and after the election.</p><p>Before you step outside, check out theweatherin your area, and if you are seeking guidance from the stars, yourhoroscope. Then dig into these wellness bites.</p><p>As the weather gets colder, you may crank up the heat, whichcan lead to cold-like symptoms, thanks to dry air as well as dust and other allergens that accumulate in your heat ducts during the rest of the year. You don’t have to suffer just to stay warm, though: Experts tell Yahoo Life that choosing a pleated filter with aMERV(Minimum Efficiency Reporting Values) rating of 11 can reduce these stuffy-nose-causing particles. Another way to avoid heater sickness is by installing humidifiers in your home that can add moisture back into the air.</p><p>Age-related macular degeneration(AMD) is a chronic eye disease typically found in older adults that affects the retina, leading to blurred vision and potential vision loss. One way to avoid it, ophthalmologistDr. Sruthi Arepallitold Parade, is to stay physically active. That’s because “exercise brings a host of good health benefits that mimic antioxidants and that can lower the risk of macular degeneration,” she explained. Be kind to your eyes by making sure you hit the CDC’s recommended 150 minutesof moderate exerciseper week, which could be as simple as a 30-minute brisk walk during your lunch break.</p><p>Hoda Kotb announcedher departure from the "Today" showin September, and now she’s opening up about how she needed to re-prioritize her life — thanks to some help from friend Maria Shriver. Kotb followed Shriver’s suggestion tomap out her life visually on a serving platter, with each area represented by proportional pieces of paper. The exercise revealed that her time was heavily skewed toward work, leaving limited space for both family time and self-care — sparking Kotb to reassess her commitments and cut back on non-essential work.</p><p>You don’t have to get out a literal platter to try it for yourself; just writing down how much time you spend on each area of your life can give you a visual representation of where your energy is going, allowing you to reassess as needed. Constantly in a state of go, go, go? Maybe you should insteadschedule some time to do nothing, which can leave you feeling more energized and inspired.</p><p>Some memory decline is a normal part of aging, but there are ways tokeep your brain sharp— and some can even be fun! Experts spoke to Yahoo Life about games you can play to promote neuroplasticity, which is our brain’s ability to change and learn. Try Sudoku: The math puzzle may help your brain function better as you age, according toa 2019 study. Plus,Dakari Quimby, clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the USC Keck School of Medicine, tells Yahoo Life that this activity hits the “sweet spot” in terms of difficulty, noting that if a brain game is “too simple, it will become boring and won’t stimulate neural circuitry,” but “if it’s too challenging, it will become frustrating.”</p><p>Nov. 1 is World Vegan Day, but you don’t have to give up animal products altogether to reap the many health benefits of a plant-based diet. While previous research found thatjust two months of vegan eatingknocked years off a person’s biological age, even making simpleplant-forward swapshas benefits byincreasing your fiber intake(something many Americans don’t get enough of) and variety of minerals and vitamins in your diet. Next time you’re considering a burger for dinner, consider switching it out for a black bean-based one instead.</p><p>The pandemic may have kept us inside for months on end, but there was one surprising benefit: an increase in family dinners. According toa studyby the American Psychological Association, family dinners can foster improved family dynamics by creating greater feelings of connection and expression of gratitude. Experts say you can still take advantage of the connection benefits now by setting time aside each week for a family catch-up over a meal. Also — try cooking together! Kids who sometimes or alwaysjoin in when their parents cooktend to eat more fruits and vegetables than children who don't help out in the kitchen.</p><p>Want to cut back on stress snacking?Go for frozen grapes— and let them melt in your mouth, Virginia-based doctor Dr. Jason Singh said in a recent TikTok. The reason, he explained, is that the cold temperature activates certain receptors in the mouth, which in turntriggers the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward.</p><p>Frozen grapes also take longer to eat, so you may end up eating fewer of them than you would with, say, M&Ms. Want something extra sweet to feel like you’re eating candy?Go for cotton candy grapes, which Aldi already sells frozen — they really do taste like the carnival treat.</p><p>Magnesium has benefits for muscle relaxation, but you don’t have to pop a supplement to reap the benefits, neuroscientistTara Swart, told Fortune. Swart recommendsbathing with magnesium flakes, which allows the chemical to be absorbed through the skin. Though research is still inconclusive, the process mayhelp soothe sore muscles(such as after a hike or weightlifting session) as well as reduce inflammation and joint pain. Try it for yourself by mixing one to three cups of magnesium flakes with bath water and soaking for 15 minutes.</p><p>More wellness tips:</p><p>Snack on pistachios— they can help prevent eye disease.</p><p>Declutter your space.
