The pace of enrollment for the PHOENIX trial remains strong, and in the quarter, we completed the Phase 1b DRAGON II trial of Tinlarebant in Stargardt disease in Japan and dosed the first patient in the Phase 2/3 portion of the trial. We are well-positioned to achieve critical milestones and look forward to providing an update on the interim analysis from our pivotal Phase 3 DRAGON trial toward the end of 2024 or early 2025,” said Dr. Tom Lin, Chairman and CEO of Belite. “In the quarter, we were also excited to welcome Dr. Scholl, a leading global expert in Stargardt disease and age-related macular degeneration, as our Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Scholl’s decision to join Belite following his experience as Chair of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board for both our Phase 2 and Phase 3 Stargardt disease trials further validates our belief in Tinlarebant’s immense potential.”Third Quarter 2024 Business Highlights and Upcoming Milestones:Clinical HighlightsTinlarebant(LBS-008) is an oral, potent, once daily retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) antagonist that decreases RBP4 levels in the blood and reduces vitamin A (retinol) delivery to the eye without disrupting systemic retinol delivery to other tissues. Vitamin A is critical to normal vision but can accumulate as toxic byproducts in individuals affected with STGD1 and GA (the advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration (dry AMD) leading to retinal cell death and loss of vision.AdvertisementStory ContinuesStargardt disease (STGD1):Accumulation of cytotoxic vitamin A byproducts (bisretinoids) has been implicated in the onset and progression of STGD1.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses were $22.7 million compared to $20.0 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to (i) a royalty payment for completion of a Phase 2 trial, and (ii) share-based compensation granted in the third quarter of 2024.G&A Expenses:AdvertisementFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were $2.9 million compared to $2.2 million for the same period in 2023.

government adrift less a month before the inauguration of a new U.S. administration that could impose crippling sanctions on Canadian exports.Chrystia Freeland quit on Monday after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau offered her a lesser position. She said his wish to increase spending could endanger Canada’s ability to withstand the damage done by the tariffs that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to impose.Freeland had headed a special cabinet committee on Canada-U.S. relations and was working closely with the 10 provinces to ensure a united response.“As a country we have to project strength and unity, and it’s chaos right now up in Ottawa,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said after a scheduled online conference call of provincial premiers on Monday to discuss the U.S. threat.AdvertisementAn unimpressed Alberta premier, Danielle Smith, one of Trudeau’s biggest domestic critics, said the provincial leaders had only learned halfway through their call that the point person on Canada-U.S. relations had quit.“It’s chaos. I’d be looking at this wondering who the next leader is … are they going to be able to bring forward a coherent plan? Is there going to be a team that is able to do a Team Canada approach?” she said.“It’s not the greatest time to have a vacuum,” she added, calling for a national election to help restore stability.Unhappy legislators from the ruling Liberal Party, some of whom have been calling on Trudeau to quit for months, met on Monday in Ottawa to vent their frustration.The Liberals are trailing badly in the polls ahead of an election that must be held by late October 2025. Trudeau has until now ruled out the idea of resigning but if pressure on him mounts significantly, the results could be unpredictable.Advertisement“Trump will be inaugurated in 34 days. Canada must have a stable government,” former Trudeau foreign policy advisor Roland Paris said in a post on X.When Trump came to power in 2017 he vowed to tear up the trilateral free trade treaty with Canada and Mexico. Freeland, who was then foreign minister, played a large role in helping renegotiate the pact and saving Canada’s economy, which is heavily reliant on the United States.Vincent Rigby, a former national security and intelligence adviser to Trudeau, said Freeland’s departure meant the Canadian stance with Trump was up in the air.“This is going to be quite problematic for the prime minister from a political perspective, but it’s now also going to be problematic in terms of how the Canadian government deals with an incoming Trump presidency,” he said on the sidelines of an event in Washington.Story ContinuesAdvertisementThe role of chief federal coordinator on U.S. relations now passes to Dominic LeBlanc, the new finance minister, who flew with Trudeau to Florida late last month to meet Trump.“The one thing I think the American administration will respect is a government that’s focused on our common priorities, on the shared issues,” he told reporters after being appointed.Freeland was not invited along. In September 2018, during the talks to rework the trilateral trade treaty, Trump made it clear he did not like Freeland.“We’re very unhappy with the negotiations and the negotiating style of Canada.

Similarly, Luis Ramos Paco, from Santiago de Llallagua, Bolivia—where growing potatoes and raising animals is necessary to provide for one’s family—now works with a US-based SaaS client to update its legacy system with a friendlier UI.The remote work revolution has opened doors for skilled professionals like Virginia and Luis worldwide. Companies like BairesDev– which connects Latin American talent with U.S. tech firms– are bridging global income gaps and allowing tech talent and software engineers into an increasingly globalized job market while staying close to their families and communities.“The region offers a rapidly expanding talent pool, strong cultural alignment, and geographical proximity to the U.S.,” Nacho De Marco, CEO and Co-Founder of BairesDev, explains. “This facilitates seamless real-time collaboration and efficient workflows. 33% of U.S. businesses now want to outsource their business operations to a country that’s close by. Professionals from Latin America have a similar work culture to their North American neighbors and possess a high level of English proficiency.”AdvertisementAs a result of this type of demand, many BairesDev workers who once faced limited opportunities in rural areas now earn between $30,000 and $80,000 annually, placing them in the top 5% of earners in their home countries.Other companies like Toptal and Adeva work in similar ways to connect talented and skilled individuals to job opportunities around the world, breaking down barriers to entry and revitalizing local economies.If you’re considering a remote job that can connect you to a different corner of the global marketplace, here are some important things to consider as you embark on your job hunt.Earn Globally, Live LocallyOne of the most significant advantages of remote work is the ability to earn in a high-income market while living in a lower-cost region. BairesDev, for instance, has had more than 6,000 of its Latin American-based workers integrate with teams in U.S. companies, like Google and Pinterest.Advertisement“During recruitment, we focus on a candidate’s competence over their credentials,” explains De Marco. “We also prioritize the future potential that someone can bring, in addition to their current skillset. This approach means discovering exceptional talent from diverse and often overlooked sources. Historically, around 40% of our developers come from non-metropolitan areas.”Yes, that means you can live a balanced lifestyle in a quaint town like San Miguel de Allende while working with a U.S.-based tech giant.Earning a higher paycheck while keeping your cost of living steady provides wealth-building opportunities, allowing you to build an emergency fund, pay off debt, and invest in property and other assets. Be sure to cross check the purchasing power of the currency you’ll be paid in to that of your local currency to ensure that you’re maximizing your potential earnings. Also make sure that the salary you’re being offered is fair compared to what employees at the company’s headquarters are making.Track Finances CarefullyOnce you’ve secured your remote job, you’ll want to set up a financial plan to ensure that you are maximizing your global paycheck without running into any snags. Opening a multi-currency bank account can help you minimize exchange rate losses and transfer fees, and many offer automations to make conversions between currencies seamless.Also make sure to budget for any potential fluctuations in the foreign currency, as factors like inflation, interest rate adjustments, and governmental changes can affect the value of the foreign currency. As long as you’re earning well above your local cost of living, it’s smart to set aside a percentage of your earnings as a buffer to offset any potential currency devaluation.AdvertisementAs you continue to earn more, it’s also wise to invest a portion of your income into diversified assets so you can grow your wealth over time. Many companies offer financial planning services as a benefit, and it can be especially helpful if you’re a first-time investor. Financial planners can also help you with your taxes, which can be more complicated when earning across borders.Maintain Motivation and Work-life BalanceThough the higher salaries in other countries can sound so enticing that you consider working odd hours, try not to jump at just any opportunity for a higher paycheck. Instead, look at the big picture and consider the fact that your long-term earning potential is contingent upon factors like work-life balance, upskilling, and staying motivated. Working with a talent company like BairesDev can help set you up for success in this regard.“By hiring candidates with strong communication skills and collaborative skills, our workforce is well-prepared to navigate the typical challenges associated with remote work,” says De Marco.For smoother collaboration with your fellow employees– and to remain present in your day-to-day life– look for jobs at companies with similar time zones to yours. This will cause minimal disruptions to your schedule, allowing you time for family and social obligations– and time for learning new skills that can help you land your next job. Popular remote industries like tech, design, and project management tend to be good about providing professional development opportunities outside of the traditional workday, and you want to remain fresh and motivated to seize grown opportunities as they come.Redefining Success: Building Wealth Across BordersIn an increasingly borderless world, the path to financial independence might be closer than you think. Companies like BairesDev are receiving over 2 million applications annually for remote work opportunities—approximately 10,000 applications every day, proving that demand for global remote jobs is continuing to grow.Advertisement“In the U.S., the demand for tech talent is outstripping supply, with roles like information security and software development expected to grow by 33% and 18%, respectively, over the next decade,” says De Marco. “Latin America is rising to meet this demand, with Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina producing significantly more software engineers annually than the U.S.”Opening doors for global talent also sparks a larger shift in how we think about work, money, and opportunity. This is not a small trend; it’s going to continue to be a defining feature of the global economy in the decades to come— and it’s very possible to make this work in your favor.For professionals considering this path, remote work offers a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between higher global earnings and a lower local cost of living. With the right financial strategies—like careful currency management, smart investment strategies, and a focus on work-life balance—there is a very real opportunity for talented employees across the globe to achieve financial freedom without uprooting their lives.</p><p>The remote work revolution has opened doors for skilled professionals like Virginia and Luis worldwide.

BairesDev, for instance, has had more than 6,000 of its Latin American-based workers integrate with teams in U.S. companies, like Google and Pinterest.Advertisement“During recruitment, we focus on a candidate’s competence over their credentials,” explains De Marco. “We also prioritize the future potential that someone can bring, in addition to their current skillset. This approach means discovering exceptional talent from diverse and often overlooked sources. Historically, around 40% of our developers come from non-metropolitan areas.”Yes, that means you can live a balanced lifestyle in a quaint town like San Miguel de Allende while working with a U.S.-based tech giant.Earning a higher paycheck while keeping your cost of living steady provides wealth-building opportunities, allowing you to build an emergency fund, pay off debt, and invest in property and other assets. Be sure to cross check the purchasing power of the currency you’ll be paid in to that of your local currency to ensure that you’re maximizing your potential earnings. Also make sure that the salary you’re being offered is fair compared to what employees at the company’s headquarters are making.Track Finances CarefullyOnce you’ve secured your remote job, you’ll want to set up a financial plan to ensure that you are maximizing your global paycheck without running into any snags. Opening a multi-currency bank account can help you minimize exchange rate losses and transfer fees, and many offer automations to make conversions between currencies seamless.Also make sure to budget for any potential fluctuations in the foreign currency, as factors like inflation, interest rate adjustments, and governmental changes can affect the value of the foreign currency. As long as you’re earning well above your local cost of living, it’s smart to set aside a percentage of your earnings as a buffer to offset any potential currency devaluation.AdvertisementAs you continue to earn more, it’s also wise to invest a portion of your income into diversified assets so you can grow your wealth over time. Many companies offer financial planning services as a benefit, and it can be especially helpful if you’re a first-time investor. Financial planners can also help you with your taxes, which can be more complicated when earning across borders.Maintain Motivation and Work-life BalanceThough the higher salaries in other countries can sound so enticing that you consider working odd hours, try not to jump at just any opportunity for a higher paycheck. Instead, look at the big picture and consider the fact that your long-term earning potential is contingent upon factors like work-life balance, upskilling, and staying motivated. Working with a talent company like BairesDev can help set you up for success in this regard.“By hiring candidates with strong communication skills and collaborative skills, our workforce is well-prepared to navigate the typical challenges associated with remote work,” says De Marco.For smoother collaboration with your fellow employees– and to remain present in your day-to-day life– look for jobs at companies with similar time zones to yours. This will cause minimal disruptions to your schedule, allowing you time for family and social obligations– and time for learning new skills that can help you land your next job. Popular remote industries like tech, design, and project management tend to be good about providing professional development opportunities outside of the traditional workday, and you want to remain fresh and motivated to seize grown opportunities as they come.Redefining Success: Building Wealth Across BordersIn an increasingly borderless world, the path to financial independence might be closer than you think. Companies like BairesDev are receiving over 2 million applications annually for remote work opportunities—approximately 10,000 applications every day, proving that demand for global remote jobs is continuing to grow.Advertisement“In the U.S., the demand for tech talent is outstripping supply, with roles like information security and software development expected to grow by 33% and 18%, respectively, over the next decade,” says De Marco. “Latin America is rising to meet this demand, with Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina producing significantly more software engineers annually than the U.S.”Opening doors for global talent also sparks a larger shift in how we think about work, money, and opportunity. This is not a small trend; it’s going to continue to be a defining feature of the global economy in the decades to come— and it’s very possible to make this work in your favor.For professionals considering this path, remote work offers a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between higher global earnings and a lower local cost of living. With the right financial strategies—like careful currency management, smart investment strategies, and a focus on work-life balance—there is a very real opportunity for talented employees across the globe to achieve financial freedom without uprooting their lives.</p><p>“The region offers a rapidly expanding talent pool, strong cultural alignment, and geographical proximity to the U.S.,” Nacho De Marco, CEO and Co-Founder of BairesDev, explains. “This facilitates seamless real-time collaboration and efficient workflows. 33% of U.S. businesses now want to outsource their business operations to a country that’s close by.
