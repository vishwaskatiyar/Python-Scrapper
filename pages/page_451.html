A hot topic at the meeting and the focus of one of theseKidney Compassepisodes,IgA nephropathy (IgAN)was a major area of nephrology research this month.</p><p>Check out thisHCPLiveOctober 2024 nephrology month in review for highlights of our coverage of the biggest renal headlines from the past few weeks!</p><p>VALIANT: Pegcetacoplan Offers Benefit for UPCR, eGFR, C3 Staining in C3G, IC-MPGN</p><p>Data from the VALIANT trial presented atASN Kidney Week 2024provide evidence positioning pegcetacoplan (Empaveli), a complement inhibitor targeting C3/C3b, as the first therapy to offer clinically meaningful benefits for proteinuria, C3c staining, and eGFR stabilization in patients with C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) or primary immune complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN).</p><p>The full presentation of VALIANT comes less than 3 months after Sobi and Apellis Pharmaceuticals announced topline results and sheds additional light on the safety and efficacy of pegcetacoplan for a pair of rare kidney diseases without approved treatments. Based on these data, Sobi and Apellis intend to file a supplemental New Drug Application to the US Food and Drug Administration in early 2025.</p><p>Related:Carla Nester, MD: Pegcetacoplan in C3 Glomerulopathy and Primary IC-MPGN</p><p>DUPLEX: Sparsentan Could Offer Greater Benefit in Genetic FSGS</p><p>A posthoc analysis of DUPLEX, the largest clinical trial to date infocal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), suggests patients with genetic FSGS (gFSGS) could benefit from sparsentan (Filspari) similar to patients with other forms of FSGS. The analysis was presented almost exactly 1 year after the presentation of the original DUPLEX trial, with results indicating patients with gFSGS experienced a more pronounced antiproteinuric response with sparsentan that was sustained across the duration of the study period.</p><p>Semaglutide Shows Promise, Reduces UACR in Nondiabetic Kidney Disease</p><p>Semaglutide (Ozempic) may be useful as a treatment for the management ofchronic kidney disease (CKD)without diabetes, according to findings from recent research. The 6-month trial compared use of semaglutide 2.4 mg against placebo therapy in patients with obesity and nondiabetic CKD, with results suggesting use of the GLP-1 receptor agonist was associated with a placebo-corrected 52.1% reduction in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR).</p><p>Kidney Compass: Navigating Clinical Trials</p><p>October saw the introduction ofKidney Compass: Navigating Clinical Trials, a guide to the latest in clinical trials and relevant updates in the world of nephrology—created by Brendon Neuen, MBBS, PhD, and Shikha Wadhwani, MD, MS, to make the changing landscape of nephrology and clinical trials within the specialty easier to understand and navigate.</p><p>The podcast features insights from Neuen and Wadhwani, but also special guests, including some of the leading trialists in the space. At ASN Kidney Week, the duo spoke with 3 experts about new trial data being presented at the meeting for the podcast’s first 3 episodes:</p><p>Kidney Compass: Atacicept for IgAN with Jonathan Barratt, MD, PhD, at Kidney Week 2024</p><p>Kidney Compass: Semaglutide for Nondiabetic Kidney Disease, with Hiddo Heerspink, PhD, PharmD, at Kidney Week 2024</p><p>Kidney Compass: FLOW Insights from Kidney Week 2024, with Katherine Tuttle, MD</p><p>Gender, IgA Nephropathy Linked to Gross Hematuria After COVID-19 Vaccination</p><p>AmongHCPLive’s most popular nephrology coverage from October was a summary of findings from a prospective nationwide multicenter cohort study conducted across 22 hospitals in Japan suggesting female patients and patients with IgAN and IgA vasculitis (IgAV) are more likely to experience gross hematuria following receipt of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Beyond the apparent sex and IgAN/IgAV bias, results also suggest specific galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) and the adaptive immune system may be involved in the development of gross hematuria following vaccination.</p><p>ORIGIN OLE Data Solidify Atacicept Disease-Modifying Potential for IgA Nephropathy</p><p>New 96-week data from the open-label extension portion of the ORIGIN trial suggest use of atacicept could slow the rate of kidney decline in patients with IgAN to a rate similar to physiological aging without kidney disease. Results of the trial show use of atacicept, a dual BAFF/APRIL inhibitor from Vera Therapeutics, was associated with sustained reductions in Gd-IgA1, hematuria, and UPCR, positioning atacicept as a disease-modifying therapy and representing an important potential advancement in the future management of IgAN.</p><p>Felzartamab Slows IgAN Decline in New Phase 2 Data</p><p>Felzartamab is well-tolerated, leads to sustained proteinuria reductions, and reduces eGFR decline in patients with IgAN compared to placebo, according to new 24-month data from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2a IGNAZ study. A monoclonal antibody, felzartamab targets CD38 on plasma cells, which is suspected to be the source of pathogenic Gd-IgA1 and autoantibodies in IgAN.</p><p>Mifepristone Notably Reduces HbA1c in Treatment Phase of CATALYST Trial</p><p>Diabetes Dialogue: Celebrating 25 Years of CGM, with Irl Hirsch, MD</p><p>Dupilumab Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis Safe for Up to 5 Years in Children, Adults</p><p>Kidney Compass: Future of PARASOL and FSGS Management</p><p>Study Discovers Constipation Has a Causal Relationship with Schizophrenia, MDD</p><p>A New Era for NMIBC: How a Decade of Progress is Reshaping Treatment</p><p>Mifepristone Notably Reduces HbA1c in Treatment Phase of CATALYST Trial</p><p>Diabetes Dialogue: Celebrating 25 Years of CGM, with Irl Hirsch, MD</p><p>Dupilumab Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis Safe for Up to 5 Years in Children, Adults</p><p>Kidney Compass: Future of PARASOL and FSGS Management</p><p>Study Discovers Constipation Has a Causal Relationship with Schizophrenia, MDD</p><p>A New Era for NMIBC: How a Decade of Progress is Reshaping Treatment</p><p>2 Commerce DriveCranbury, NJ 08512</p><p>609-716-7777</p>
