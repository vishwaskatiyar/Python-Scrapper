                    <h1>LumiThera Receives FDA Authorization for Valeda Treatment for Dry AMD</h1>
                    <h2>Paragraphs:</h2>
                    <p>The U.S. FDA has granted LumiThera authorization to market its Valeda Light Delivery System, the first FDA-authorized device designed to treat vision loss in patients with dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This significant approval, obtained through the De Novo authorization pathway, marks a major milestone in noninvasive treatments for dry AMD.</p><p>The FDA’s De Novo authorization for Valeda represents an important step forward in treating dry AMD. LumiThera’s President and CEO, Clark Tedford, PhD, stated:</p><p>“We’ve worked tirelessly to bring the Valeda device to U.S. patients. With this FDA authorization, we can now offer dry AMD patients a noninvasive treatment that may help preserve vision and delay disease progression, representing a significant advance in ocular health.”</p><p>Valeda employs photobiomodulation (PBM), a noninvasive, light-based therapy aimed at enhancing visual acuity in dry AMD patients. In clinical trials, Valeda achieved significant results:</p><p>•Improvement in Visual Acuity:Patients showed an increase in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) by over 5 letters, with results sustained over a 24-month period.</p><p>•LIGHTSITE III Trial Success:In the pivotal U.S. LIGHTSITE III trial, Valeda met its primary endpoint, demonstrating both safety and efficacy in improving and maintaining visual acuity over two years.</p><p>The positive data from the LIGHTSITE III trial allowed LumiThera to submit a De Novo request to the FDA, providing a technical package and evidence for classification of Valeda as a Class II device with special controls. Lori Holder, Vice President of Regulatory Affairs at LumiThera, noted the significance:</p><p>“The De Novo authorization established Valeda as the first device for treating dry AMD patients with vision loss, setting a benchmark for future PBM devices in this class to meet equivalent performance standards.”</p><p>In addition to visual acuity improvements, Valeda therapy has shown promising effects on several anatomical markers of AMD:</p><p>•Reduction in Geographic Atrophy:Analysis of retinal biomarkers by Dr. Glenn Jaffe of Duke Reading Center indicated a reduction in the incidence of geographic atrophy (GA) in eyes treated with Valeda, with treated eyes showing a GA incidence rate of 6.8% compared to 24% in control eyes.</p><p>Following the initial review of its LIGHTSITE III data under a premarket approval (PMA) application in 2023, the FDA advised LumiThera to proceed with a De Novo request. This pathway enabled classification of Valeda as a Class II device, establishing special controls and performance standards for PBM technology aimed at treating dry AMD.</p><p>Ophthalmology Breaking News delivers cutting-edge information to ophthalmologists and promotes continuing education by covering such topics as surgical pearls, complications management, technological advances, and practice management.</p>
