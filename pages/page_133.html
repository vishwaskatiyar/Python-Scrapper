                    <p>HAYWARD, Calif.,Nov. 11, 2024/PRNewswire/ -- Avirmax’s Chief Executive and Scientific Officer, Dr. Shengjiang Shawn Liu, Ph.D., will chair the upcoming session of “Acceleration of AAV Gene Therapy for Ocular Diseases: Improving Delivery and Quality,at theVirtual Frontiersin Ocular Gene Therapy Research Conference,November 13th, 12:00 –1:15 pm ET. The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO), is the largest international society dedicated to ophthalmology and vision (https://www.arvo.org).</p><p></p><p>AAV is the top vector choice for use in gene therapies for its stable expression, strong biosafety rating, low immunogenicity, convenient ocular delivery routes and high product stability. Dr. Liu will present “Development and implementation of the recombinant baculovirus-Sf9 Cell (VSaf™AAV) platform technology for in AAV GMP production for human ocular gene therapy”, at the virtual ARVO conference session. This presentation will explore the AAV platform technology, (VSaf™ AAV), used in manufacturing of gene therapy vectors for use in ocular applications. Vector quality control testing and viral safety will be discussed.</p><p>The VSaf™ rAAV platform technology can yield AAV vector as high as 8x1015vg/liter using VSaf™ Sf9 cell culture. The platform technology was used for ABI-110 GMP clinical manufacturing. ABI-110, an AAV vector carrying vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antagonist gene has received IND approval from the FDA to initiate Phase I/IIa trials in the US in May of this year. The clinical trial is currently enrolling clinical patients at multiple sites across the country (https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06550011).</p><p>About Avirmax Inc.</p><p>Contact</p><p>June Song, Associate Director for Operations</p><p>Email:business@avirmax.com</p><p>Tel: +1-510-641-0201</p><p>Address</p><p>Hayward94545 CA</p><p>USA</p><p>Frontiers in Ocular Gene Therapy Research Conference</p><p>Registration open</p><p>View original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/avirmax-inc-to-present-at-the-arvo-frontiers-in-ocular-gene-therapy-research-conference-302301659.html</p><p>SOURCE Avirmax</p><p></p><p>© 1985 - 2024 BioSpace.com.
