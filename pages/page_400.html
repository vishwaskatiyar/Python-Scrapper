                    <h2>Paragraphs:</h2>
                    <p>MALVERN, Pa., Nov.  08, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ocugen, Inc. (Ocugen or the Company) (NASDAQ: OCGN), a biotechnology company focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing novel gene and cell therapies, biologics, and vaccines, today reported third quarter 2024 financial results along with a general business update.</p><p>“I am very encouraged by the progress of our gene therapy programs and the clinical and regulatory milestones achieved in the third quarter of 2024, including the expansion of the OCU400 Phase 3 liMeliGhT clinical trial into Canada,” said Dr. Shankar Musunuri, Chairman, CEO, and Co-founder of Ocugen. “With the recent equity and debt financings, we have sufficient cash-on-hand to continue supporting our robust ophthalmology pipeline and extend our cash runway into 1Q2026.”</p><p>As OCU400 is advancing through Phase 3 clinical development, the expanded access program (EAP) for adult patients with early to advanced RP makes it possible to reach a greater segment of the RP patient population—300,000 in the U.S., Canada, and Europe combined. Additionally, including Canadian patients in the OCU400 Phase 3 liMeliGhT trial may allow for broader commercialization with the U.S. and Europe. These accomplishments and consistent trial enrollment are bringing the Company even closer to providing a potential one-time treatment for life to patients living with RP.</p><p>Phase 2 of the OCU410 Phase 1/2 ArMaDa clinical trial is underway and will assess the safety and efficacy of OCU410 in a larger group of patients who are randomized into either of two treatment groups (medium- or high-dose) or a control group. OCU410 is being developed for geographic atrophy (GA), an advanced stage of dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD). GA affects approximately 2-3 million people in the U.S. & EU. Current FDA-approved treatments address only the complement system and require approximately 6-12 intravitreal injections per year, whereas OCU410 addresses all four pathways linked with dAMD pathophysiology and is delivered through a single subretinal injection. There remains no approved product to treat GA in the EU.</p><p>Over a series of conferences during the third quarter 2024, Ocugen had the opportunity to provide an update on its three clinical-stage modifier gene therapies to significant investor audiences as well as industry decision-makers during meetings like the Cell & Gene Meeting on the Mesa hosted by the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine.</p><p>“It is imperative to continue educating our key stakeholders about the differentiated mechanism of action of our gene-agnostic modifier gene therapy platform,” said Dr. Musunuri. “Unlike other product candidates in development to treat blindness diseases, our approach leverages master gene regulators that reset the functional network—rather than targeting a single mutation—and restore overall health to the retina. Our data continues to support the potential to treat multiple disease mutations with a one-time therapy for life.”</p><p>While gene therapy remains the primary focus for the Company, Ocugen continues to pursue funding opportunities across the portfolio to ensure that its innovative platforms reach the people who need them.</p><p>A clinical showcase, providing updates from Ocugen’s ongoing gene therapy trials, will be held on November 12, 2024, and will include preliminary safety and efficacy data from the Phase 1/2 OCU410 ArMaDa clinical trial for geographic atrophy and Phase 1/2 OCU410ST GARDian clinical trial for Stargardt disease, along with RP and LCA data updates from the OCU400 Phase 1/2 clinical trial.</p><p>Ophthalmic Gene Therapies—First-in-class</p><p>Ophthalmic Biologic Product</p><p>Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results</p><p>Conference Call and Webcast Details</p><p>Ocugen has scheduled a conference call and webcast for 8:30 a.m. ET today to discuss the financial results and recent business highlights. Ocugen’s senior management team will host the call, which will be open to all listeners. There will also be a question-and-answer session following the prepared remarks.</p><p>Attendees are invited to participate on the call or webcast using the following details:</p><p>Dial-in Numbers:(800) 715-9871 for U.S. callers and (646) 307-1963 for international callersConference ID:9923172Webcast:Available on theeventssection of the Ocugeninvestor site</p><p>A replay of the call and archived webcast will be available for approximately 45 days following the event on the Ocugeninvestor site.</p><p>About Ocugen, Inc.Ocugen, Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing novel gene and cell therapies, biologics, and vaccines that improve health and offer hope for patients across the globe.
