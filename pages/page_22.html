According to the company, the phase 2b clinical trial met all primary end points with no serious adverse events reported in either cohort.1</p><p>Read more...</p><p>By Thomas A.

What do clinical optometrists and ophthalmologists need to know when discussing blue light–blocking ophthalmic lenses with our patients?</p><p>Read here...</p><p>By Steven Ferrucci, OD, FAAO and Emily Kaiser Maharjan, Assistant Managing Editor</p><p>Steve Ferrucci, OD, FAAO, discussed the detection and treatment of geographic atrophy (GA) during his AAOpt 2024 lecture, "Imaging Techniques and Emerging Therapies for Geographic Atrophy," given alongside Carolyn Majcher, OD, FAAO. Ferrucci emphasized the importance of early detection through multimodal imaging, including color, fundus photos, fundus autofluorescence, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). New FDA approved medications, such as Syfovre and Izervay, can slow GA progression by 25-35%, preserving usable vision. Ferrucci highlighted that patients with extrafoveal lesions or hyperfluorescence around lesions should be referred promptly. He stressed the urgency of recognizing GA now that treatments are available, as vision loss can occur rapidly once lesions start growing.</p><p>Watch here...</p><p>ByCarrie Roitstein, OD, cPNP, INHC</p><p>The cornea, the ocular window to the world, plays a crucial role in vision. In addition to protecting the eye from outside infiltration and UV radiation, the cornea is responsible for approximately 65% to 75% of the refraction of light as it passes through the eye.1 The cornea performs the initial refraction onto the lens, which further focuses the light onto the retina. The tear layer is comprised of lipid, aqueous, and mucin components necessary for the maintenance of corneal health, as they offer protection as well as maintain a moist and clean interface. The cornea does not contain any blood vessels, since transparency is needed for the eye’s function. It receives nutrients through diffusion on its external side from tear fluid and the aqueous humor internally.1 Therefore, maintaining the integrity of the cornea is essential for clear vision, as we expand on the impact of nutrition. In this article, I will detail how nutrition contributes to the homeostasis of corneal health.</p><p>Read here...</p><p>By Emily Kaiser Maharjan, Assistant Managing Editor, and Jordana Joy, Associate Editor</p><p>Eye care providers far and wide came to lecture and learn about the latest innovations in eye care at this year's AAOpt meeting in Indianapolis, Indiana, from November 6-9. The key takeaways from this optometry conference include the exciting advancements in ocular surface treatments and technologies, as well as the ongoing research into the genetics and progression of keratoconus. Several speakers highlighted the wealth of new products and treatments in the pipeline, with Ian Ben Gaddie, OD, FAAO, noting that in a single course, they reviewed 6-7 promising new ocular surface products that will be available in the next 3 years. This speaks to the rapid pace of innovation in the field and the enthusiasm among clinicians about these advancements.</p><p>Watch here...</p><p>Results released in 4-year myopia control study of Diffusion Optics Technology in children</p><p>You and Eye: Vision training research in eSports - with Tiffany Tsoi, OD, FAAO</p><p>EyePoint begins dosing in second global Phase 3 LUCIA clinical trial of Duravyu for the treatment of wet AMD</p><p>You and Eye: Myopia cannot be viewed as a specialty in today's practice setting</p><p>Lifitegrast improves clinical signs and biomarkers of patients with DED: A Q&A with Dr. James Thimons</p><p>Galimedix Therapeutics initiates Phase 1 trial of oral GAL-101</p><p>Results released in 4-year myopia control study of Diffusion Optics Technology in children</p><p>You and Eye: Vision training research in eSports - with Tiffany Tsoi, OD, FAAO</p><p>EyePoint begins dosing in second global Phase 3 LUCIA clinical trial of Duravyu for the treatment of wet AMD</p><p>You and Eye: Myopia cannot be viewed as a specialty in today's practice setting</p><p>Lifitegrast improves clinical signs and biomarkers of patients with DED: A Q&A with Dr. James Thimons</p><p>Galimedix Therapeutics initiates Phase 1 trial of oral GAL-101</p><p>2 Commerce DriveCranbury, NJ 08512</p><p>609-716-7777</p>
