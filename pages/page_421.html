                    <p>Alex Delaney-Gesing</p><p></p><p>The National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) National Eye Institute (NEI) has awarded two researchers—one from Columbia University and another from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute $6.4 million to find theirco-clinical development of an investigational compoundfor the treatment of two retinal diseases:</p><p>The multimillion-dollar grant will be dispersed over a5-year periodto support drug development activities and an investigational new drug (IND)-enabling toxicology studies.</p><p>Read up on the details.</p><p>AMD is, most notably, one of the most common culprits behind vision loss in adults, with12.6%of Americans aged 40+ living with the vision-threatening condition (as of 2019).</p><p>Even further:Dry AMD—occurring when there’s a build up of lipofuscin within the retina—is referred to as “themost prevalent form” of this disease, with 6.9% of adults aged 40+ living with it in 2019 (a 5.1% increase).</p><p>Lipofuscin consists of yellow-brown pigment granules that naturally accumulate in aging cells (such asretinal pigment epithelium[RPE]) as a direct result of the body’s aging process—or, in some cases, disease.</p><p>Specifically, these granules includepyridinium bisretinoids, which comprise theprimary cytotoxic elementsof retinal lipofuscin (i.e., dry AMD and SD).</p><p>The investigators—Konstantin Petrukhin, PhD, professor of Ophthalmic Science at Columbia University as well as Christopher Cioffi, PhD, the Thomas and Constance D’Ambra professor in Organic Chemistry at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute—are looking to block the synthesis of these bisretinoids in order to treat dry AMD.</p><p>By focusing in on thisbisretinoid synthesis, which is determined by retinol traffic passing through the bloodstream to the retina and a retinol binding protein (RBP4) - Transthyretin (TTR) complex operating as the main carrier that delivers retinol to the eye.</p><p>From there:RBP4 antagonists displace this retinol from RBP4, resulting in the RBP4-TTR complex to separate and lipofuscin bisretinoid synthesis to become suppressed.</p><p>The investigatorsnotedthat “disrupting the RBP4-TTR interaction could potentially destabilize wild-type TTR tetramers and promote TTR aggregation in individuals with age-related predisposition to TTR amyloidosis disease (ATTR).”</p><p>Cioffi and Petrukhin haveintroduced a new classof investigational compounds—specifically referred to as “orally bioavailable bispecific drugs”—that act as “both RBP4 antagonists and TTR tetramer kinetic stabilizers.”</p><p>Their purpose:To reduce serum RBP4 levels along with suppressing bisretinoid synthesis and binding to TTR’s thyroxine binding sites.</p><p>This research resulted in the discovery of an advanced preclinical candidate that targets treatment for dry AMD patients with age-related predisposition to TTR amyloidosis,according tothe investigators.</p><p>Cioffi added that the bispecific compounds have shown “therapeutic potential to treat atrophic age-related dry AMD and (SD).”</p><p>Plus,Petrukhin notedthat the candidate combines optimal safety and efficacy and is intended to “emerge as a new and improved therapy for macular degeneration, benefiting diverse patient populations in need of enhanced treatment options.”</p><p></p><p>Eyes On Eyecare is currently distributing our 2024 media kit and Eyes On event prospectuses.
