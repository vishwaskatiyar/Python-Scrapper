                    <p>Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences</p><p>Cataract surgery is a highly effective way to restore clear vision after development of a cataract, but some patients still experience refractive errors after surgery, like nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. If you’ve had cataract surgery but still find yourself needing glasses or contacts, you may be wondering if LASIK or PRK is an option to further enhance your vision.PRK and LASIKare both popular laser vision correction procedures, but they differ in technique and suitability, especially for patients with specific eye conditions. Here’s a guide on whether PRK after cataract surgery could be right for you, what to consider, and the benefits it can bring.</p><p>“There are two corneal refractive surgery options to correct refractive errors after cataract surgery: LASIK and PRK. We have found that PRK surgery is a safer option after cataract surgery. PRK surgery is just as effective in correcting refractive errors as LASIK.”</p><p>During cataract surgery, the eye’s cloudy natural lens is replaced with a clear artificial lens, called an intraocular lens (IOL). This procedure dramatically improves vision affected by cataracts. Modern IOLs can even correct some refractive errors, and premium options, like multifocal or toric lenses, provide sharper vision at multiple distances, which often reduces the need for glasses. However, in some cases, patients may still experience minor refractive errors or may want additional fine-tuning, which is where LASIK could be beneficial.</p><p>How PRK Can Enhance Vision After Cataract Surgery</p><p>PRK reshapes the cornea to correct refractive errors. While cataract surgery replaces the lens of the eye, PRK modifies the cornea, making them complementary procedures. If you’re experiencing mild refractive errors after cataract surgery, PRK can be an option to achieve even sharper, more precise vision by correcting any residual nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism.</p><p>Dr. Stephen Wexler, Medical Director of WashU LASIK , notes “many cataract surgery patients nowadays get specialty implants that can correct for near vision. These multifocal implants work best when the patient has very little refractive error. PRK is an easy, low risk way get the vision as clear as possible after cataract surgery.”</p><p>Professor of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences</p><p>Medical Director Washington University LASIK Surgery Center</p><p>Medical Director Washington University LASIK Surgery Center</p><p>If you’re considering PRK after cataract surgery, you’ll need to meet certain criteria to be an ideal candidate. Here are some of the primary factors that your optometrist will evaluate:</p><p>The PRK procedure after cataract surgery is similar to traditional PRK. It’s quick, minimally invasive, and performed on an outpatient basis. Here’s a general overview of what you can expect:</p><p>Alternatives to PRK for Post-Cataract Vision Correction</p><p>If you’re not a candidate for PRK, there are other options to enhance your vision post-cataract surgery:</p><p>For those seeking sharper vision and more freedom from corrective eyewear after cataract surgery, PRK may be an excellent option to address residual refractive errors. By working closely with your eye doctor to assess your unique vision needs, you can determine if PRK is a safe and effective choice for enhancing your post-cataract vision.</p><p>Whether through PRK, another vision correction procedure, or advanced lens options during cataract surgery, there are numerous ways to achieve clear, comfortable vision for the long term. Always consult with an experienced ophthalmologist to understand which options best align with your eye health and vision goals.</p><p>Washington University School of Medicine</p><p>Contact Us</p><p></p><p>Faculty Job Openings</p><p>Staff Job Openings</p><p>Employee Portal (login required)</p><p>Join our e-Newsletter mailing list</p><p>©2024 Washington University in St. Louis</p>
