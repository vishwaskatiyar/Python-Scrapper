For IgA nephropathy,recent guidelinesemphasize more aggressive treatment even at lowerproteinurialevels, with new drugs like sibeprenlimab targeting specific pathways involved in the disease’s progression.</p><p>Complement inhibitors, such asravulizumaband iptacopan, were also discussed for their promising impact on reducing kidney inflammation and proteinuria. In treating C3 glomerulopathy, Dr Klomjit noted the potential of investigational drugs likepegcetacoplanand iptacopan to improve both proteinuria and GFR, bringing hope for future advancements in treating these rare glomerular diseases.</p><p>Medscape © 2024 WebMD, LLC</p><p>Any views expressed above are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect the views of WebMD or Medscape.</p><p></p><p>Cite this: ASN 2024: Applying New Data to Patients With Glomerular Diseases -Medscape- Nov 15, 2024.</p><p>Assistant Professor of Medicine, Division of Nephrology and Hypertension and Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota; Staff Physician, Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Minneapolis, MinnesotaDisclosure: Nattawat Klomjit, MD, has disclosed the following relevant financial relationships:Serve(d) as an advisory board member for: Calliditas Therapeutics</p><p>You have already selectedfor My Alerts</p><p>Click the topic below to receive emails when new articles are available.</p><p>You've successfully addedto your alerts.
