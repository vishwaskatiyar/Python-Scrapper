                    <p></p><p>Each week there is an announcement about a scientific breakthrough related to implants. This time, it is people of a certain age who are affected by vision problems due to macular degeneration who are concerned. Science Corporation, the company behind the Prima Brain Implant (BCI), has revealed preliminary results of its solution following a clinical trial in 38 patients from five countries with geographic atrophy.</p><p>Results obtained 6 and 12 months after the system was installed showed that the implant restored “shape vision” in patients who had lost their central visual field. Concretely, this system allows them to perform high-speed tasks, such as reading or facial recognition. After receiving the Prima implant, patients were able to read with significant improvement, including regaining the ability to recognize letters.</p><p>“For the first time, it was possible to restore true form vision to retinas damaged by age-related macular degeneration.“, said Professor Frank Holz, MD, scientific coordinator of the PRIMAvera study.”Previously, there was no real treatment to improve the vision of these patients.“, added Professor Holz, Chairman of the Department of Ophthalmology at the University of Bonn in Germany.</p><p>It’s a real turning point in the field for Max Hodak, head of Science Corporation, who says he’s excited to bring the technology to market in the coming years. This study also aims to prove its safety.</p><p>The Prima System consists of several elements beyond a surgically integrated photovoltaic implant behind the retina. A special pair of glasses, as well as a pocket processor are required along with the camera and projection system.</p><p>The full study is available here.</p><p>Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p><p></p><p>Comet Tsuchinshan-Atlas visible in the French night sky should give us a spectacle for a few days before disappearing. Here is a selection of the most beautiful images of this new trend that ignites the night sky at the beginning of autumn.</p><p>After the Northern Lights, it’s the turn of Comet Tsuchinshan-Atlas (or C/2023 A3) to delight skywatchers.of the nightof the night. Considered the “comet of the century”, it is currently visible.the eyethe eyeI am nakedNorthern HemisphereNorthern HemisphereAnd especially in France.</p><p>However, this spectacle is not guaranteed. Because powerfulStormStormBasically solar energyNorthern LightsNorthern LightsCould have made it disappear last week. It should be remembered that comets are mostly icy bodies and that it is common for them to be disintegrated as a result of the upwelling pressure of the gases during their close passes, like ours.SoleilSoleil. But no, he retained our greatest joy.</p><p>To see it, all you have to do is have a clear sky (which is certainly not guaranteed at this point) and turn west during the evening pollution hour from 7:30 p.m.</p><p>gaveshineshineAs it falls, the comet will appear just above the horizon, as a bright point decorated with a long faint tail extending upward. It can be seen with the naked eye, but with a pair of binoculars, the spectacle is even more beautiful. To find it more easily, you can bring one.ApplicationApplicationMobileMobileor look for the fairly strong glow of Arcturus. Then find the area of ​​the sky to the left of that star.</p><p>However, we must not delay: visible in our sky since October 12, the Tsuchinshan-Atlas will gradually decrease in intensity for about ten days, until it disappears.</p>
