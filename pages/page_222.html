                    <p>An official website of the United States government</p><p>Hereâs how you know</p><p>Omega-3s (short foromega-3 fatty acids) are a kind of fat found in foods and in the human body. They are also sold asdietary supplements. They are sometimes referred to asn-3s.Â</p><p>Several types of dietary supplements contain omega-3s.</p><p>For some health conditions, the evidence for benefits from seafood (fish and shellfish) is stronger than the evidence for omega-3 supplements.</p><p>There is some evidence that people with heart disease or high triglycerides may benefit from taking omega-3 supplements.</p><p>Eating seafood (fish and shellfish) has been linked to a moderate reduction in the risk of stroke.</p><p>Triglycerides are a type of fat found in peopleâs bodies; excessive levels may raise the risk of heart disease. Lifestyle changes such as dietary modifications, weight control, and exercise are used to lower triglyceride levels. Some people also need to take medicine to lower their triglyceride levels.</p><p>Although some studies have had promising results, itâs uncertain whether omega-3 fatty acid supplements are helpful for depression.</p><p>There is some evidence that ADHD could be related to lower dietary intake of omega-3 and higher dietary intake of omega-6 fatty acids. However, research on omega-3 supplements for ADHD has had conflicting results. Itâs uncertain whether omega-3s have any benefit for symptoms of this condition.</p><p>Some research indicates that people who eat more seafood may have a reduced risk of cognitive decline.</p><p>Studies of omega-3s for multiple sclerosis have shown some beneficial effects on relapse rates, inflammation, and improving quality of life. Omega-3s have also been studied for autism spectrum disorders, with research to date suggesting no beneficial effects. Omega-3s may be a beneficial treatment for people with borderline personality disorder, particularly for impulsive behavioral dyscontrol (the inability to control impulses or behaviors) and affective dysregulation (the impaired ability to regulate and/or tolerate negative emotional states). EPA has been found to reduce positive, negative, depressive, and anxious symptoms associated with schizophrenia and may reduce violent behaviors as well. Medium- and long-term efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in stable schizophrenia is not known. Further, additional evidence regarding their effects on these and other mental health conditions varies.</p><p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease that can cause vision loss in older people.</p><p>Dry eye disease is a common condition that affects millions of Americans each year. It can cause discomfort, redness, blurry vision, and sensitivity to light.</p><p>Side effects of omega-3 supplements are usually mild. They include unpleasant taste, bad breath, bad-smelling sweat, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as heartburn, nausea, and diarrhea.</p><p>The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) is supporting studies on omega-3s, including:</p><p>Take charge of your healthâtalk with your health care providers about anycomplementary health approachesyou use.
