                    <p>The scientific program hit full stride here on Day 2 of the 17th Congress of the Asia-Pacific Vitreo-retina Society (APVRS 2024). We’re covering the day’s biggest sessions in geographic atrophy (GA), macular holes, artificial intelligence and more—and taking a look at what we’ve been up to in our second home of Singapore.</p><p>It’s the end of Day 2 here in Singapore for APVRS 2024, and in terms of both the scientific program and crowd factor, the biggest of the Congress so far.</p><p>The slow trickle of Day 1 has given over to the steady din of Day 2 outside of lecture rooms and in the exhibition hall, as arriving delegates attacked a juicy slate of retinal symposia and innovation at the Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre.</p><p>Geographic atrophy once again proved itself as one of 2024’s premier topics in retina. After multiple sessions on the disease yesterday, including Prof. Usha Chakravarthy’s (United Kingdom) treatment of structural and functional endpoint disharmony in the disease, GA was back on the menu on Day 2.</p><p>In one of our daily highlight sessions, a global cast of experts from Dr. Michael Singer (USA) to Prof. Fred Chen (Australia)took a deeper look at the state of the art in GA, including issues facing complement inhibition and promising therapeutics coming down the pipeline.</p><p>Day 2 also saw the awarding of the final three of APVRS 2024’s six awards (check out our Day One coverage for the rest). TheConstable Lecture,Dennis Lam Lecture,andRichard Fan Award Lecturesaw a selection of global retina’s rising and established stars take the mic on artificial intelligence, macular holes and macular degeneration—don’t miss out on our in-depth coverage of these marquee prizes!</p><p>If you’re here in Singapore, you’ve probably noticed our agency video crew around the Suntec Centre filming key opinion leaders talking about some of the biggest industry innovations on display.</p><p>Being in Singapore is like being home for us—the city is not only one of our two official homes (along with Da Nang, Vietnam), but is also the birthplace of the company itself all those years ago.</p><p>Over the years, the Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre has seen its fair share of Media MICE shenanigans—including some of the triumphs (and outrageous stunts!) that have shaped our funky foray into both Asian and global ophthalmology.</p><p>This year, we’re continuing our legacy of contributions to covering ophthalmology, and our editorial team isn’t the only one at work. Our video crew spent the day before the conference hanging out atProf. Tina Wong’sclinic at the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC), and we’ll be giving you a peek into what we saw there very soon.</p><p>Early morning on Day 1 saw us over at theLKC boothgetting testimonials from doctors on their hand-held electroretinography tech and how it’s shaping screening and testing for retinal disease in some of the region’s areas of critical needs.</p><p>Topconalways keeps the video team busy, and we spent the rest of Day 1 and early on Day 2 with them, including their swanky after-hours event showcasing products like theMYAH.</p><p>Your correspondent even got in on the action on Day 2, including interviews withProf. Giuseppe Giannacarre (Italy)andDr. Giulia Coco (Italy)on photobiomodulation in dry AMD and dry eye with Espansione’s Light Modulation low-level light therapy(LM®LLLT).</p><p></p><p>Day 3 sees us return for one final day of editorial coverage as things wind down here in Singapore. So if you’re around in Singapore, come say hi—and if you’re not, check back in soon with our final day of scientific program reporting.</p><p>Editor’s Note: Reporting for this story took place during the 17th Congress of the Asia-Pacific Vitreo-retina Society (APVRS 2024) from 22-24 November in Singapore.</p><p></p><p></p><p>6001 Beach Road, #09-09 Golden Mile Tower Singapore 199589</p><p>view map</p><p>Tel:(+65) 8186 7677Fax:(+65) 6298 6316Email:enquiry@mediamice.com</p><p>Send your work samples to emaileditor@mediamice.com</p><p></p><p></p><p>© 2024 PIE Magazine</p><p>Terms of Use</p><p></p>
