                    <p></p><p>Pistachios are fun to eat but they are also very nutritious: they contain healthy fats such as unsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and are a source ofvitamins and mineralsin addition to being a delicious and nutritious food.</p><p>And its list of benefits does not end there. Eating pistachios is nourishing yourself with vitamin E, aantioxidantwhich helps protect cells against oxidative damage caused by free radicals and is a source of iron that contributes to normal cognitive function. They provide tryptophan, an essential amino acid that cannot be manufactured by the body itself, which means that it must be supplied to the body externally through food, so it is advisable to include pistachios in your daily diet as part of a balanced diet. This essential amino acid, among other functions, is necessary for the production of serotonin, an important neurotransmitter in the human body.</p><p>Pistachios to see better</p><p>But not only that. Pistachios, for some time now, have become an object of debate. Does taking 2 handfuls of pistachios a day help protect your eyes?as you get older? This is stated in the new study from Tufts University (Massachusetts, United States), led by Dr. Tammy Scott. The research on “regular consumption of pistachios with an increase in the optical density of macular pigment in healthy adults” concludes that ingesting56 grams of pistachios per daycan significantly improve eye health by increasing levels of a key antioxidant that helps protect vision.</p><p>The study, which was led by researchers at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, demonstrates that pistachio provides substantial amounts of aplant pigmentcalled lutein, which can help increase themacular pigment optical density(DOPM). This important part of the eye filters visible and harmful blue light, and protects it againstage-related macular degeneration(AMD). This is one of the main causes of blindness in older adults.</p><p>More benefits of pistachios</p><p>Knowing this, it is not surprising that we find pistachios in numerous preparations. Without going any further, llaollao has recently included a pistachio topping so that those who are loyal to this fruit can add it to their yogurts. Among its ocular benefits are:</p><p>– Improve eye health in just 6 weeks: Healthy middle-aged and older adults who eat 56 grams of pistachios (about 2 handfuls) every day, show significant increases in MPOD, in just six weeks.</p><p>– Provides antioxidant lutein: Pistachios are the only nut with measurable amounts of lutein. This antioxidant acts as a blue light filter and may help protect your eyes from light damage. Additionally, it supports long-term vision health. In the study, lutein intake nearly doubled; while blood lutein levels rose significantly.</p><p>Llaollao pistachio topping.</p><p>– Protects age-related vision: Study suggests pistachios could be a simple, natural way to help reduce the risk of AMD. This is a serious eye condition that affects millions of people as we age.</p><p>As Dr. Scott explains, “Lutein is an antioxidant that acts like sunglasses for your eyes. Lutein is selectively absorbed into the retina and helps filter harmful blue light from computer screens and sunlight. At the same time, this nut can help reduce damage to the delicate parts of the eye.</p><p>On the other hand, the consumption of pistachio can help reverse a low intake of lutein. In the study, pistachios provided about 1.6 mg of lutein, which would be enough to double the average daily lutein intake in adults. In this sense, Dr. Scott clarifies that “by simply incorporating a handful of pistachios into the diet, we can improve the intake of lutein, crucial for protecting the eyes.” In addition, the expert explains that pistachio is a source of healthy fat. , which can help the body better absorb the lutein in this dried fruit.</p><p>Recipes with pistachios</p><p>Below are some ideas to incorporate pistachios into your menu if you don’t feel like eating them loose:</p><p>Recipe 1. Pistachio pesto</p><p>Pistachio pesto recipe.</p><p>@edeand</p><p>– 50 grams of natural unsalted pistachios</p><p>– 1 or 2 cloves of garlic</p><p>– 45/50 g. fresh basil</p><p>– 80 ml. EVOO</p><p>– 30 grams of parmesan reggiano</p><p>– Salt to taste</p><p>Store in an airtight jar in the refrigerator. I reserve a little water from cooking the gnocchi and mix it with the pesto.

I used a grinder as it was a small quantity. Start by beating the eggs until they turn white for a couple of minutes and then add the erythritol and beat again for another minute.</p><p>Now add the rest of the wet ingredients: yogurt, evoo, pistachio cream, vanilla. And mix again. Finally, integrate the dry ones.⠀⠀⠀⠀</p><p>Pour into your mold and microwave for 5 minutes at maximum power. You can also prepare it in the oven/airfryer, but in that case the time changes. Unmold, and let it cool on the base as well.</p><p>For the coverage, melt 50 g. of unsweetened white chocolate in the microwave in a couple of 30” batches, mixing halfway through. And mix with 30/40 g. of pistachio cream.</p><p>Recipe 3. Cocoa and pistachio cream</p><p>Cocoa and pistachio cream.</p><p>@lasmariacocinillas</p><p>– 150 grams of peeled pistachios</p><p>– 130 grams of chocolate</p><p>– 2 tablespoons VE olive or coconut oil</p><p>Toast the pistachios and let cool.
