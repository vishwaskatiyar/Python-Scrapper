                    <h1>Ocugen Announces Compelling Preliminary Data for OCU410—a Single Dose Novel Modifier Gene Therapy to Treat Geographic Atrophy Secondary to Dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration</h1>

                    <p>MALVERN, Pa., Nov.  19, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ocugen, Inc. (Ocugen or the Company) (NASDAQ: OCGN), a biotechnology company focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing novel gene and cell therapies, biologics, and vaccines, today announced positive preliminary efficacy and safety data from the Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the Phase 1/2 OCU410 ArMaDa clinical trial for geographic atrophy (GA), secondary to dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD). Key findings include: no drug-related serious adverse events, reduced lesion growth, preservation of retinal tissue, and—most importantly—there was a positive effect on the functional visual measure of low luminance visual acuity (LLVA).</p><p>Currently, there are approximately three million people living with GA in the United States (U.S.) and Europe combined. Patients in the U.S. have only one option available, anti-complement therapy, which requires multiple injections and only addresses one aspect of the disease. There remains no treatment option for GA in Europe.</p><p>The OCU410 Phase 1 trial is evaluating nine patients in three dose cohorts (low, medium, and high). The following data was observed for the three patients in the low dose cohort at six months:</p><p>“Currently approved treatments for GA have not shown significant benefit in visual function. More importantly, we often do not realize the logistical challenge and emotional burden both patients and their caregivers must endure for every month or every other month visits,” said Syed M. Shah, MD, FACS, Director of Retina Service, Vice Chair for Research & Digital Health at Emplify Health – La Crosse, Wisconsin. “Based on the science and preliminary data, OCU410 has the potential to improve structural as well as functional outcomes. This ‘one-and-done’ treatment paradigm can be a gamechanger for how we treat patients with GA.”</p><p>“OCU410 addresses multiple aspects of the disease beyond the complement pathway,” said Dr. Huma Qamar, Chief Medical Officer at Ocugen. “The latest OCU410 data emphasizes the potential of novel modifier gene therapy as a one-time treatment for dAMD. We remain very encouraged by the latest safety and efficacy data and positive patient outcomes.”</p><p>Ocugen also announced promising data from the Phase 1/2 OCU410ST GARDian clinical trial for Stargardt disease and data on Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) from the Phase 1/2 OCU400 clinical trial. All these findings, as well as commentary from study investigators and patient perspectives, were shared at the Company’s recent Clinical Showcase. The data affirms the potential for modifier gene therapy to address both rare inherited retinal diseases and blindness diseases affecting millions.</p><p>A full replay of the showcase is available on theEventssection of the Ocugen website.
