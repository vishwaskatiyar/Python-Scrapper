                    <p>Metformin, a common Type 2 diabetes, may offer protection against a 
subtype of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), according to astudypublished in Investigative Ophthalmology & Vision Science (IOVS).</p><p>This
 is the latest among other studies suggesting that the medication may 
have several uses beyond diabetes, such as promoting longevity and 
weight loss and protecting against neurological disorders, cancer, and 
cardiovascular disease. Most of the proposed uses are off-label, which 
means the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the 
medication to treat those conditions.</p><p>While research on some 
off-label metformin uses is promising, studies on other uses are 
inconsistent. Some are controversial because they may not offer the best
 approach for addressing a health issue. Additionally, although 
metformin is generally well-tolerated, it does have some adverse effects
 and is not for everyone.</p><p>Macular
 degeneration, a condition mainly associated with aging, affects the 
retina and involves the loss of central vision. The primary types of AMD
 are wet AMD and dry AMD. Geography atrophy (GA) is a subtype of dry 
AMD. GA leads to legal blindness in16 percentof those who have it.</p><p>In recent years, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) medications, which decrease the growth of blood vessels in the eye, have revolutionized treatment for wet AMD.</p><p>Conversely,
 treatments for GA have lagged. In 2023, pegcetacoplan and avacincaptad 
pegol came on the market, but they only slow GA’s progression rather 
than prevent the condition.</p><p>Studies on the treatment of dry AMD 
with metformin have been encouraging, but they have not focused on GA 
specifically. Because of the limited research on metformin’s effect on 
GA and the condition’s debilitating visual effects, researchers 
undertook the IOVS study.</p><p>This case-control experiment involved 
older individuals with new-onset GA and a control group who did not have
 it. The researchers looked at exposure to metformin in the preceding 
year to determine whether any correlations were present. Data analysis 
indicated an association between metformin and reduced risk of new-onset
 GA. The researchers concluded that further research is necessary to 
verify the findings, but metformin may provide a noninvasive alternative
 treatment in preventing GA.</p><p>Mechanisms of action underlying the 
benefit of metformin on GA are unclear, but there are several 
possibilities. Instead of the protective effects stemming from a blood 
sugar-lowering action useful for diabetes, the effects may be due to the
 medication’s anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, based on 
animal and test tube studies.</p><p>Is it possible that taking a pill can prolong your life? Areviewpublished in Frontiers in Endocrinology noted that metformin may 
decrease the likelihood of early death associated with diabetes, cancer,
 cognitive decline, and cardiovascular disease, which could lengthen the
 period of life spent in good health.</p><p>Factors underlying 
metformin’s anti-aging effects include its ability to lower high blood 
sugar, boost insulin sensitivity, and decrease oxidative stress. The 
medication also has a direct protective effect on blood vessel function,
 which may improve blood flow.</p><p>Despite these positive effects, the
 researchers expressed reservations about using metformin as a 
prophylactic (preventive) measure to promote longevity. Dependence on a 
pill could reduce the incentive to adopt healthy lifestyle practices, 
such as exercise and a nutritious diet, which have proven beneficial. 
Additionally, long-term metformin use may cause vitamin B12 deficiency. 
In light of these considerations, people should not view the drug as a 
“quick fix” for aging.</p><p>Dr. Markus Ploesser, a psychiatrist and 
integrative medicine physician at Open Mind Health, concurs with the 
researchers’ viewpoint. In an email to The Epoch Times, he stated that 
metformin has several beneficial effects that may enhance longevity; 
“however, its use as an anti-aging drug is still not fully proven.”</p><p>Ploesser
 added that it is essential to balance the possible benefits against 
risks and to consider it within a broader context of other 
longevity-promoting strategies, such as diet, exercise, sleep 
optimization, and stress management.</p><p>“Taking a pill alone is 
unlikely to be the healthiest approach for most people, as a 
comprehensive lifestyle strategy has much stronger evidence for 
promoting longevity,” he said.</p><p>Metformin may promote weight loss, but its use is best reserved for a select population.</p><p>Areviewpublished in Current Obesity Reports stated that it suppresses the 
appetite and may also increase the abundance of bacterial strains in the
 gut microbiome, an effect associated with healthier weight. However, 
research on the weight-loss effects of metformin shows either modest 
improvement or inconsistent results. Consequently, the FDA has not 
approved the medication for obesity.</p><p>Guidelines from the American 
Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American College of 
Endocrinology advise the use of metformin for obese individuals who have
 prediabetes or insulin intolerance and have not responded to other 
medications for obesity or lifestyle modifications. Current use of the 
drug for obesity is strictly off-label, but doctors often prescribe it 
for people with a high risk of obesity-related complications who can’t 
tolerate other interventions, noted the Current Obesity Reports review.</p><p>Dr.
 Michael Lahey, a physician specializing in metabolic health and weight 
management at My Weight Loss Partner, told The Epoch Times via email 
that although some research shows metformin might promote weight loss, 
it is not an anti-obesity medication.</p><p>“In my experience, I stand 
to defend the facts that making the necessary lifestyle changes—such as 
proper dieting, reliable exercise, and positive behavioral change—has 
the strongest bearing for long-term, effective weight loss,” he said. 
“It can be suggested that metformin may be used as a second-line 
treatment, in particular, if insulin resistance is quite pronounced; 
nonetheless, it should not be used alone.”</p><p>Areviewpublished in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences indicates 
that metformin may protect against neurological conditions, including 
Alzheimer’s disease and major depressive disorder.</p><p>The mechanisms 
that underlie the protection are not fully understood, but several 
actions may play a role. Metformin may help prevent damage to the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB), a tight layer of cells that prevents harmful 
substances from entering the brain. Damage to the BBB can result in 
neuroinflammation and injury, leading to neurodegeneration.</p><p>Metformin
 also moderates autophagy, a natural cleaning process that improves 
cellular function. It also regulates synaptic transmission, where 
neurotransmitters are released that send signals from one nerve cell to 
another, and plasticity, or the ability of neural networks to grow and 
reorganize.</p><p>Areviewpublished in Pharmaceuticals reported that an estimated two-thirds of 
the deaths of people with diabetes are attributable to cardiovascular 
disease. Among this group, approximately 40 percent stem from coronary 
artery disease, 15 percent from heart failure and other types of heart 
disease, and about 10 percent from stroke. Consequently, reducing the 
likelihood of these risks is paramount.</p><p>Most clinical studies 
indicate that metformin may decrease the likelihood of chronic blood 
vessel-related complications of diabetes and significantly lower 
modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. The latter includes increased 
platelet aggregation, unhealthy blood lipids, belly fat, obesity, 
oxidative stress, high blood glucose, and inflammation.</p><p>According
 to the Pharmaceuticals review, chronic kidney disease affects about 30 
percent of people with Type 1 diabetes and approximately 40 percent of 
those with Type 2 diabetes. This result of chronically high blood sugar 
affects tiny blood vessels and frequently leads to end-stage kidney 
disease. Existing medications are ineffective, and many people 
eventually need dialysis or a kidney transplant.</p><p>Metformin has 
kidney-protective properties that can stop kidney tissue injuries caused
 by various toxins, including high blood glucose.</p><p>This benefit’s 
underlying mechanisms of action are complex and not fully known. A 
factor that plays a key role is metformin’s activation of the enzyme 
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which results in beneficial effects
 in kidney cells. AMPK serves as a vital energy source in the cell and 
regulates cellular protein, glucose, and lipid metabolism.</p><p>People
 with diabetes, particularly Type 2 diabetes, have a higher risk of 
developing certain cancers, including breast, bladder, endometrium, 
pancreas, liver, and colon and rectum, noted the review in 
Pharmaceuticals. Metformin has a desirable effect on certain cancer risk
 factors, such as high body weight, high blood sugar, and insulin 
sensitivity.</p><p>Research shows the medication reduces the risk of 
cancer in people with diabetes, but exactly how it achieves this 
protective effect is only partly understood. One factor involves an 
indirect action on tumor cells caused by the blood sugar- and 
insulin-lowering effects, which may suppress cancer cell proliferation. 
Additionally, researchers have proposed that metformin has several 
direct anti-cancer effects, such as the activation of AMPK in tumor 
cells.</p><p>While some studies suggest the medication may reduce the 
risk of cancer, others do not. The inconsistency shows that randomized 
studies are needed to determine the value of metformin in cancer.</p><p>Metformin is generally well-tolerated, but up to30 percentof people experience gastrointestinal effects, such as nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.</p><p>Australian
 physician and board-certified nutritionist Dr. Peter Brukner told The 
Epoch Times via email that people with the following conditions or risk 
factors should avoid metformin:</p><p>Kidney problems:The kidneys remove metformin from the body, so the medication is not 
eliminated properly if they are not working well. This can cause lactic 
acidosis, a complication where the blood pH drops and becomes acidic, 
causing severe illness.</p><p>Liver problems:The liver also has a job in handling metformin. Liver disease puts a person at risk of lactic acidosis.</p><p>Breathing problems or heart issues:A person with severe breathing problems or heart issues might not get 
enough oxygen. This, too, can make them more likely to develop lactic 
acidosis.</p><p>History of lactose acidosis:If someone has experienced lactic acidosis before, it is a good idea not to take metformin because the problem may come back.</p><p>Pregnant or breastfeeding women:Metformin is not always suggested for women who are pregnant or 
breastfeeding since its impact on the baby is not entirely known. 
Doctors often seek safer choices in such situations.</p><p>Certain medications:Some medications do not go well with metformin and can create problems.
 These include those that raise the risk of lactic acidosis, such as 
bupropion, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and cephalexin and medications
 that enhance its blood sugar-lowering effect, such as salicylates and 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Individuals should 
inform their doctor about all the medications they use to avoid drug 
interactions.</p><p>Anyone desiring to take metformin with one of these conditions should discuss it with their doctor, Brukner advises.</p><p>While
 further research is needed, metformin’s uses for disease prevention may
 be valid. However, doctors must weigh the benefits against the risks 
for each individual. In cases where a person is highly likely to develop
 a particular condition, the benefits may exceed the risks.</p><p>Authored by Mary West via The Epoch Times,</p><p>Pasaulio naujienos kitaip... Įvairios žinios iš viso pasaulio nuo politikos, ekonomikos iki konspirologijos. Medicinos naujienos.</p><p></p><p></p>
