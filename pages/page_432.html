                    <p>health centers/eyesight center/treatments fail with wet macular degeneration article</p><p>Current treatments sometimes fail to help people with “wet”age-related macular degeneration-- and researchers now think they know why.</p><p>Wet AMD is caused by an overgrowth of blood vessels in the retina, the light-sensing tissue at the back of the eye. The vessels leak fluid or bleed, damaging the retina and causing vision loss.</p><p>To combat this, doctors prescribe medications that slow the growth of new blood vessels, called anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor)drugs.</p><p>Unfortunately, these anti-VEGFdrugsmight actually hamper vision improvements by triggering the over-expression of a second blood-vessel-related protein, researchers have discovered.</p><p>This second protein, ANGPTL4, also can stimulate overproduction of abnormal blood vessels in the retina, researchers reported Nov. 4 in theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p><p>These findings could explain why fewer than half of patients who receive monthly anti-VEGF eye injections wind up showing any major improvements in their vision, researchers said.</p><p>“We have previously reported that ANGPTL4 was increased in patients who did not respond well to anti-VEGF treatment,” said researcher Dr. Akrit Sodhi, an associate professor of ophthalmology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, in Baltimore.</p><p>“What we saw in this paper was a paradoxical increase of ANGPTL4 in patients that received anti-VEGF injections -- the anti-VEGF therapy itself turned on expression of this protein,” Sodhi said in a Hopkins news release.</p><p>For the study, researchers compared VEGF and ANGPTL4 levels in the eye fluid of 52 patients with wet AMD, all of whom were receiving anti-VEGF treatments.</p><p>After anti-VEGF treatment, their VEGF levels decreased but their ANGPTL4 levels rose. Such ANGPTL4 activity could promote more damaging blood vessel overgrowth, researchers said.</p><p>The team then investigated ways to limit ANGPTL4 levels, using an experimental drug on mice with wet AMD.</p><p>The drug decreases levels of a third protein, HIF-4, known to be involved in wet AMD by promoting VEGF production.</p><p>The drug also decreased VEGF and ANGPTL4 levels in mice, and limited overgrowth of blood vessels, researchers found.</p><p>Combining the experimental drug with existing anti-VEGF meds proved more effective than either drug alone in mice, results showed.</p><p>“This work exposes a way to improve anti-VEGF therapy for all patients and potentially help a subset of patients with wet AMD who still lose vision over time despite treatment,” Sodhi said. “Our hope is that this [project] will further the three goals we have related to wet AMD: make current therapies as effective as possible, identify new therapies and prevent people from ever getting wet AMD."</p><p>More information</p><p>The American Academy of Ophthalmology has more onage-related macular degeneration.</p><p>SOURCE: Johns Hopkins Medicine, news release, Nov. 4, 2024</p><p>Copyright © 2024 HealthDay.
