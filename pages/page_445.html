                    <p>Metamorphopsia isa visual defect that causes linear objects, such as lines on a grid, to look curvy or rounded. It's caused by problems with the eye's retina, and, in particular, the macula.</p><p>Metamorphopsia was defined asthe deviation of either vertical or horizontal lines, reported by the patient, and consisted of the first visual disturbance sometimes preceding clinical appearance of maculopathy [6,7].Is Metamorphopsia macular degeneration?In macular degeneration,distorted visionoften refers to metamorphopsia, or when straight lines appear wavy. This is noted when a patient looks at the Amsler grid; the lines become noticeably distorted and wavy.Can macular degeneration be cured?Althoughthere is no cure for AMD, there are treatment options that may prevent or slow the progression of the disease.What does the Amsler grid look like if you have macular degeneration?If you have dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), it is important to monitor your vision with an Amsler grid. The grid will help you detect the progression of dry AMD to the wet form of the disease at an early, treatable stage. The grid looks likea piece of graph paper with a small dot in the center.</p><p>Is Metamorphopsia macular degeneration?In macular degeneration,distorted visionoften refers to metamorphopsia, or when straight lines appear wavy.

This defect can be caused by age, retinal tears, and diseases like diabetes, which affect vascular regions in the eye. ERMs begin by cells growing on the smooth retinal membrane.</p><p>Foods to avoid with macular degenerationProcessed foods that contain trans fats.Tropical oils, like palm oil (use vitamin E–rich safflower and corn oil instead)Lard and vegetable shortening, and margarine.High-fat dairy foods (eggs in moderation are a good source of eye-healthy nutrients)Fatty beef, pork and lamb.</p><p>In late stages of AMD, you may have difficulty seeing clearly. On average, it takesabout 10 yearsto move from diagnosis to legal blindness, but there are some forms of macular degeneration that can cause sight loss in just days.</p><p>What are the symptoms of macular degeneration?Difficulty adapting to low light levels, or needing brighter light when reading or doing close work.Gradual increase in haziness of your central or overall vision.Difficulty recognizing faces.A blurred or blind spot in the center of your field of vision.</p><p>Ways to prevent age-related macular degeneration:Quit smoking. “Rules 1, 2 and 3 are stop smoking,” says Rosenthal. ...Know your family history. ...Eat leafy greens. ...Take supplements. ...Wear sunglasses. ...Maintain a healthy blood pressure and weight. ...Test yourself with an Amsler grid.</p><p>Conclusion: After successful retinal detachment surgery, metamorphopsiagradually improved, but nearly half of the patients still exhibited metamorphopsia at 12 months postoperatively.</p><p>CSCR causesblurred or distorted vision(metamorphopsia) with visual acuity varying from 20/30 to 20/200. The condition can worsen due to postoperative steroid medication after cataract surgery.</p><p>Remedies you may consider for coping with floaters include:Hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid eye drops are often used after eye surgery to reduce inflammation and help with the recovery process. ...Diet and nutrition. ...Rest and relaxation. ...Protect your eyes from harsh light. ...Floaters naturally fade on their own.</p><p>What Causes Keratoconus?eye allergies.excessive eye rubbing, and.connective tissue disorders like Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.</p><p>Eye floaters are the small spots that can drift aimlessly across your field of vision. They are often noticeable when staring at a computer monitor or similarly bright, blank background. Floaters canoften distort or blur vision, but this tends to be a passing issue that resolves itself.</p><p>Mosteye floatersare caused by age-related changes that occur as the jelly-like substance (vitreous) inside your eyes becomes more liquid. Microscopic fibers within the vitreous tend to clump and can cast tiny shadows on your retina. The shadows you see are called floaters.</p><p>Tragically, most people who develop AMD go undiagnosed for up to seven years before the condition is detected and treatment can begin.There is currently no cure for AMD. At best, treatment can slow or sometimes even halt the progression of the disease.</p><p>Individuals with vision loss from age-related macular degeneration look fine. Their eyes appear tobe just like they always were and their peripheral (side) vision is preserved, so they can walk around with little or no difficulty and may even spot a small dark button dropped on a light rug.</p><p>Age-related macular degeneration usually begins atage 55 or older. There is a very low risk of progression from the early stage to the late stage of AMD (which involves vision loss) within five years after diagnosis.</p><p>As the disease progresses, the blind spots will grow larger, and eventually lead to a total loss of central vision. As a result,your ability to drive safely may no longer be possible.</p><p>Macular degeneration is an age-related eye disease that involves damage to the retina and often causes low vision. Since the damage to retina is not related to the shape of the cornea, the length of the eyeball, or the power of the lens,it cannot be corrected with eyeglasses or contact lenses.</p><p>The good news is, millions of them continue living their life and continue doing what they always did. Although age related macular degeneration is a frustrating condition, it'smanageable and living with macular degeneration can be made easy and normal in various ways.</p><p>Bananas, apples and peaches also havea lot of vitamin C. Fruits also contain antioxidant carotenoids, so they do double duty for your eyes. Experts debate the benefits of omega-3s, which are found in fish oil, but evidence suggests they may lower your risk of developing macular degeneration or slow its progress.</p><p>A study done at Cornell University showed that an ingredient in coffee called chlorogenic acid (CLA), which is 8 times more concentrated in coffee than caffeine, is astrong antioxidantthat may be helpful in warding off degenerative retinal disease like Age Related Macular Degeneration.</p><p>Vitamins can help certain patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) decrease their risk of losing central vision....The AREDS2 Formulalutein 10 milligrams (mg)zeaxanthin 2mg.vitamin C 500mg.vitamin E 400IU.zinc oxide 80mg or 25mg (these two doses worked equally well), and.cupric oxide 2mg.</p>
