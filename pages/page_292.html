Progression to wet AMD or geographic atrophy (GA) was confirmed using imaging studies. Generalized linear mixed-effects models assessed associations between qCSF and OCT biomarkers, while Cox regression models evaluated the association with progression to late AMD.</p><p>The results showed 134 patients and 205 iAMD eyes (age: 73 [69-78] years; 63% female) were included. Higher central subfield RPE volume and more intraretinal hyperreflective foci (iHRF) were associated with reduced AULCSF, CA, and CS at 6-12 cpd (P<0.05). Inner ring ONL thinning and more iHRF were associated with reduced CS at 1 and 3 cpd (P<0.05). During follow-up, 35 eyes developed wet AMD (17%), and 53 progressed to GA (26%), SDD, inner ring ONL thinning, and reduced CS at 1.5 cpd were associated with wet AMD (P<0.05). Higher inner ring RPE volume, hDC, SDD, higher HRF count, and reduced CS at 1 cpd were associated with GA (P<0.05)</p><p>Investigators concluded the significant structure-function relationships between OCT biomarkers and qCSF-measured CS in iAMD, emphasizing the impact of AMD alterations on contrast sensitivity function and offering valuable insights for patient stratification and prognostication.</p><p>Source:ajo.com/article/S0002-9394(24)00523-3/abstract</p><p></p><p>View all posts</p><p>The latest articles and insights from your colleagues in your specialty(ies) of choice.</p><p>SUBSCRIBE NOW</p><p>View all newsletters</p><p>Dec 17, 2024</p><p>Dec 17, 2024</p><p>Dec 17, 2024</p><p>Dec 17, 2024</p><p>Dec 17, 2024</p><p>Dec 17, 2024</p><p>The latest articles and insights from your colleagues in your specialty(ies) of choice.</p><p>SUBSCRIBE NOW</p><p>View all newsletters</p><p>Dec 17, 2024</p><p>Dec 17, 2024</p><p>Dec 17, 2024</p><p>Dec 17, 2024</p><p>Dec 17, 2024</p><p>Dec 17, 2024</p><p>Insights from the leaders in medical research, trending topics in clinical medicine, and perspectives from your colleagues.</p><p>Subscribe to our free Newsletters to receive weekly emails, and even get a laugh or two from our medical cartoons.</p><p>SUBSCRIBE NOW</p><p>About Physician’s Weekly</p><p>Careers</p><p>Memberships & Verifications</p><p>Press</p><p>Advertise With Us</p><p>Our Partners</p><p>Blog</p><p>Terms & Conditions</p><p>Privacy Policy</p><p>Editorial Policy</p><p></p><p>Contact Us</p><p>Figure1.com</p><p>OncWeekly.com</p><p>The content of this site is intended for healthcare professionals.</p><p>Any views and opinions expressed are those of the author(s) and/or participants and do not necessarily reflect the views, policy, or position of Physician’s Weekly, their employees, and affiliates.</p>
