In the U.S., treatment options are limited to anti-complement therapies requiring multiple injections, which address only one aspect of the disease. There is currently no approved treatment for GA in Europe.1</p><p>Syed M. Shah, MD, FACS, director of Retina Service and Vice Chair for Research & Digital Health at Emplify Health, La Crosse, Wisconsin, opined that currently approved treatments for GA have not shown significant improvements in visual function.</p><p>“Moreover, the logistical and emotional burdens of monthly or bi-monthly treatments can be substantial for both patients and caregivers,” Shah said. “Based on the science and early data, OCU410 has the potential to improve both structural and functional outcomes. Its ‘one-and-done’ approach could redefine how we treat GA.”</p><p>The Phase 1 trial enrolled 9 patients across 3 dose cohorts (low, medium, and high). At 6 months, data from the low-dose cohort (three patients) demonstrated:</p><p>“OCU410 targets multiple disease pathways beyond complement inhibition,” said Huma Qamar, MD, chief medical officer at Ocugen. “These preliminary data highlight the promise of our modifier gene therapy platform as a one-time treatment for dAMD. The observed safety and efficacy profiles, coupled with meaningful patient outcomes, are encouraging.”</p><p>In July 2024, Majda Hadziahmetovic, MD, an associate professor of Ophthalmology, Vitreoretinal Diseases and Surgery at Duke University Eye Center, and the lead investigator for the OCU410 Phase 1/2 trial, pointed out in a news release there currently are 2 FDA approved anti-complement therapies for GA, which targets only one pathway for a disease that has a multifactorial and complex etiology.2</p><p>“Though these treatments are a significant milestone, they provide limited benefits and involve a continuous regimen of multiple intravitreal injections over several years. This modifier gene therapy could potentially transform the landscape of GA treatment,” Hadziahmetovic said.</p><p>Ocugen also reported promising data from the Phase 1/2 OCU410ST GARDian trial for Stargardt disease and the Phase 1/2 OCU400 trial for Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). These findings, alongside insights from study investigators and patient testimonials, were presented at the Company’s recent Clinical Showcase. The data affirm the potential of modifier gene therapy to address both rare inherited retinal disorders and common causes of blindness affecting millions.</p><p>Atsena Therapeutics completes dosing in Part A of Phase I/II clinical trial evaluating ATSN-201 to treat X-linked retinoschisis</p><p>Connect, learn, and innovate in a family-friendly atmosphere:  What to expect at EnVision Summit 2025</p><p>Tenpoint Therapeutics and Visus Therapeutics complete merger, combining ophthalmic therapeutics portfolios</p><p>Innovation Series: Expanding access to eye care, advice for aspiring innovators from DMEI ophthalmology residents (part 3)</p><p>Beacon Therapeutics announces positive 3-month data from Phase 2 DAWN trial of AGTC-501 in patients with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa</p><p>New study highlights retinopathy risk from hair dye use</p><p>Atsena Therapeutics completes dosing in Part A of Phase I/II clinical trial evaluating ATSN-201 to treat X-linked retinoschisis</p><p>Connect, learn, and innovate in a family-friendly atmosphere:  What to expect at EnVision Summit 2025</p><p>Tenpoint Therapeutics and Visus Therapeutics complete merger, combining ophthalmic therapeutics portfolios</p><p>Innovation Series: Expanding access to eye care, advice for aspiring innovators from DMEI ophthalmology residents (part 3)</p><p>Beacon Therapeutics announces positive 3-month data from Phase 2 DAWN trial of AGTC-501 in patients with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa</p><p>New study highlights retinopathy risk from hair dye use</p><p>2 Commerce DriveCranbury, NJ 08512</p><p>609-716-7777</p>
